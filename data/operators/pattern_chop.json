Unlike the Wave CHOP its purpose is generating arrays of samples that have no reference to time (seconds or frames).\t\t\nIt is useful for curve generation like lookup tables, simple shapes that can be converted to SOPs, generating channels that are passed to the Geometry COMP to generate instances, and other non-time-based curve-generation, with as little need to make expressions in Python.\t\t\t\nAll defaults are in samples, not seconds or frames (though like all CHOPs, it carries with it a sample rate). There is no start-end, just Length in samples.\t\t\t\nTip: To display a  viewer in the units of samples, make the Viewer Active and change RMB -> Units to be Samples.\t\t\t\nThe Pattern  optionally takes one input  to match the length and sample rate, and, choosing via the Combine Channels menu, Appends or Inserts the new channel(s), Replaces the incoming channels, Adds to the incoming channels or Multiplies the incoming channels.\t\t\t\nThe Pattern  defaults to one cycle of the curve over the length of the , no matter how many samples long.\t\t\t\nTip: Customizing each channel: The python object for the Pattern  has a chanIndex member, so if Pattern generates three channels you can put something like [1, 3, 7][me.chanIndex] in any parameter to customize its value for each channel. For example, in the Type parameter, put the expression ['sin', 'cos', 'ramp'][me.chanIndex] to get 3 different curve types.\npatternCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of one cycle of the pattern.\n\n const - (1) sin - (-1 to 1) cos - (-1 to 1) tri - (-1 to 1) ramp - (0-1) rampsamples - (0 to numSamples-1) square - (-1 to -1) pulse - (0-1) random - (0-1) randomcycle - All samples in a cycle will have the same randomly generated value. randomnonrepint - This wave type is used in conjunction with the Randomize pulse.

In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1.

      "description": "The Pattern  generates a sequence of samples in a channel. Unlike the Wave CHOP its purpose is generating arrays of samples that have no reference to time (seconds or frames).\t\t\nIt is useful for curve generation like lookup tables, simple shapes that can be converted to SOPs, generating channels that are passed to the Geometry COMP to generate instances, and other non-time-based curve-generation, with as little need to make expressions in Python.\t\t\t\nAll defaults are in samples, not seconds or frames (though like all CHOPs, it carries with it a sample rate). There is no start-end, just Length in samples.\t\t\t\nTip: To display a  viewer in the units of samples, make the Viewer Active and change RMB -> Units to be Samples.\t\t\t\nThe Pattern  optionally takes one input  to match the length and sample rate, and, choosing via the Combine Channels menu, Appends or Inserts the new channel(s), Replaces the incoming channels, Adds to the incoming channels or Multiplies the incoming channels.\t\t\t\nThe Pattern  defaults to one cycle of the curve over the length of the , no matter how many samples long.\t\t\t\nTip: Customizing each channel: The python object for the Pattern  has a chanIndex member, so if Pattern generates three channels you can put something like [1, 3, 7][me.chanIndex] in any parameter to customize its value for each channel. For example, in the Type parameter, put the expression ['sin', 'cos', 'ramp'][me.chanIndex] to get 3 different curve types.\npatternCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  wavetype -  - The shape of one cycle of the pattern.\n\n const - (1) sin - (-1 to 1) cos - (-1 to 1) tri - (-1 to 1) ramp - (0-1) rampsamples - (0 to numSamples-1) square - (-1 to -1) pulse - (0-1) random - (0-1) randomcycle - All samples in a cycle will have the same randomly generated value. randomnonrepint - This wave type is used in conjunction with the Randomize pulse.

A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Pattern_CHOP&oldid=30822\"",

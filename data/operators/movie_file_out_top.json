      "description": "From Derivative\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJump to navigation\n\t\tJump to search\n\t\t\nThe Movie File Out  saves a  stream out to a movie file (.mov/.mp4) using a variety of codecs, including the H.264/H.265, Hap Q, NotchLC, Apple ProRes and Animation video codecs. It can also save single frame images, image sequences, or stop-frame movies. \t\t\nFor codecs that support Alpha, use the 'Movie Pixel Format' parameter to select a format that includes alpha.\nThe Export Movie Dialog is a user interface built around the Movie File Out .\t\t\t\nTo record movies with audio using the Movie File Out , a Time Sliced  with mono or stereo channels of audio is required. If TouchDesigner is running at a lower frame rate than the target video frame rate and a  is specified for audio, the Movie File Out  will automatically repeat video frames to ensure the video and audio stay in sync.\t\t\t\nRecording a movie without frame drops can be done in non-realtime by turning off the Realtime flag at the top of the user interface.\t\t\t\t\nThe length of the video is not predetermined and depends on the amount of time the Record parameter is on. \t\nYou can record a sequence of .tif or .exr files by setting the Type parameter to Image Sequence. When Image File Type is set to OpenEXR, the EXR page has options to record any number of color channels from multiple TOPs into an EXR image file, and can create it with metadata that would get read by a Point File In TOP.\nH264/H265 NOTE: Encoding movies in H.264/H.265 codec is only available with a Commercial or Pro license. Nvidia graphic hardware is also required.\t\t\t\n*** WARNING -  Driver Timeout on long  activities *** Encoding some formats at high-resolution may be a slow, -intensive operation. Generally only the RGBA BC7 mode for HapQ can suffer from this though. Consequently it will usually take longer than the default 2 seconds per frame that Windows gives the  driver to complete an operation. If you see a message saying that Windows has reset the  driver, this is the issue you are running into. To fix the issue, create this registry value:\t\t\t\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers\\TdrDelay\t\t\t\nThe value should be of type REG_DWORD. The value is the number of seconds an operation can take before the OS resets the  driver. Set it to something larger, like 20-40 (seconds), depending on the resolution you intend to encode. You must reboot your machine for this setting to take effect. If you still get driver resets, make it even larger.\t\t\t\nRecording still images and stop-frame animation can be done by changing the 'Type' parameter. Then the 'Add ' pulse button can be pulsed manually or via a script to cause the frames to be written.\nSee also Movie File In TOP, Recording Movies with Audio.\nmoviefileoutTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  type -  - Output either a movie, image, image sequence, or stop-frame movie.\n\n movie - Records a movie file. image - Records a single image. imagesequence - Records a sequence of images. stopframemovie -\n\n  videocodec -  - Select the video compression codec used to encode the movie.\n\n rle - Run-length encoded video, lossless codec and low decode times, but very large file size.

Pause must be On to enable the Add Frame parameter.\n\n\n\n  maxthread - When outputting sequences of images, this controls the maximum number of threads can be used to output images (one thread per image). If this is set to 1 then the main thread will be used to write the image.\n\n\n\n  headerdat - The path to a  that stores header metadata that should be written to the output image or movie file. Header data is written as key-value pairs with the first column storing the keys and the second column storing the associated values. Note: Currently only supported for EXR files. Warning: Files may fail to save if the header data conflicts with system headers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inputs page can be used to add extra channels of image data to the output file and to change the names of the base 4 channels.\nEach 'Additional Input ' is a path to a  containing the image data to add to the file. The associated Red, Green, Blue and Alpha parameters are the names assigned to that input's channels in the new file. If the channel parameter is left blank, that channel will not be added to the output file. Channels with duplicate names will be overwritten.\nNote: Additional inputs are currently only supported in EXR images and sequences. In EXR files, channels are stored in alphabetical order.\n\n  pointcloud - When enabled, an additional header will be added to the file that indicates the contents are point data rather than images. This header is used to automatically load the file into a Point File In TOP rather than a Movie File In TOP when dragging and dropping.\n\n\n\n  input - Sequence of TOPs containing image data to add to the file\n\n\n\n  input0r - Name assigned to the specified 's Red channel.\n\n\n\n  input0g - Name assigned to the specified 's Green channel.\n\n\n\n  input0b - Name assigned to the specified 's Blue channel.\n\n\n\n  input0a - Name assigned to the specified 's Alpha channel.\n\n\n\n  input1top - The path to the  used to specify addition channels to the EXR file.

When this is off recording may start on a later frame, after the file has been opened. Turning this off can avoid a stall in playback, if missing recording some frames at the start is acceptable.\n\n\n\n  profile -  - Select the H.264 profile to use.\n\n autoselect - baseline - main - high -\n\n  preset -  - The H264 preset to use.\n\n none - Select from the available presets. lossless -\n\n  bitratemode -  - Select between Constant or Variable bit rate, and regular or high quality bit rate modes.\n\n constant - variable - constanthq - variablehq -\n\n  avgbitrate - Set the average bitrate target for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  peakbitrate - Set the peak bitrate allowed for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  keyframeinterval - Set the number of frames between key-frames (I-frames) while encoding.\n\n\n\n  maxbframes - Controls the maximum number of B-frames (bi-directional frames) that will be created between pairs of key-frames.\n\n\n\n  motionpredict -  - Controls the quality of the Motion Prediction used when encoding H264/H265.\n\n default - quarter - half - full -\n\n  frameslicing - Controls if H264/H265 frames are sliced into multiple pieces, allowing them to be decoded using multiple CPUs more easily.\n\n\n\n  numslices - The number of slices each frame is split into.\n\n\n\n  entropymode -  - Controls which entropy mode is used for H265 encoding.\n\n autoselect - cabac - cavlc -\n\n  secondarycompression - Hap uses a secondary CPU compression stage usually. Encoding video without this compression will result in faster playback, but potentially larger file sizes (which would require faster drives to play back).\n\n\n\n  encodetestmode - This mode disables file writting, and only does the encoding. This is useful to test the /CPU performance of encoding while taking the SSD speed out of the equation.\n\n\n\n  mipmaps - When saving out .dds file, mipmaps can be included if this is enabled. This is primarily used for the PreFilter Map TOP, which will encode special information into the mipmap levels of the texture which needs to be maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A).

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA form of DATs (Data Operators) that is structured as rows and columns of text strings.\n\n\n\nEach SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nIn the Animation component each keyframe specifies a channel's value at a specific time (or frame). A keyframe holds a value, slopes and accelerations, and an interpolation type. A channel's keyframes are used to interpolate and determine the values of all the samples of the channel.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Movie_File_Out_TOP&oldid=32418\"\n\t\tCategory: TOPs",

It can also save single frame images, image sequences, or stop-frame movies. \t\t\nFor codecs that support Alpha, use the 'Movie Pixel Format' parameter to select a format that includes alpha.\nThe Export Movie Dialog is a user interface built around the Movie File Out .\t\t\t\nTo record movies with audio using the Movie File Out , a Time Sliced  with mono or stereo channels of audio is required. If TouchDesigner is running at a lower frame rate than the target video frame rate and a  is specified for audio, the Movie File Out  will automatically repeat video frames to ensure the video and audio stay in sync.\t\t\t\nRecording a movie without frame drops can be done in non-realtime by turning off the Realtime flag at the top of the user interface.\t\t\t\t\nThe length of the video is not predetermined and depends on the amount of time the Record parameter is on. \t\nYou can record a sequence of .tif or .exr files by setting the Type parameter to Image Sequence. When Image File Type is set to OpenEXR, the EXR page has options to record any number of color channels from multiple TOPs into an EXR image file, and can create it with metadata that would get read by a Point File In TOP.\nH264/H265 NOTE: Encoding movies in H.264/H.265 codec is only available with a Commercial or Pro license. Nvidia graphic hardware is also required.\t\t\t\n*** WARNING -  Driver Timeout on long  activities *** Encoding some formats at high-resolution may be a slow, -intensive operation. Generally only the RGBA BC7 mode for HapQ can suffer from this though. Consequently it will usually take longer than the default 2 seconds per frame that Windows gives the  driver to complete an operation. If you see a message saying that Windows has reset the  driver, this is the issue you are running into. To fix the issue, create this registry value:\t\t\t\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers\\TdrDelay\t\t\t\nThe value should be of type REG_DWORD. The value is the number of seconds an operation can take before the OS resets the  driver. Set it to something larger, like 20-40 (seconds), depending on the resolution you intend to encode. You must reboot your machine for this setting to take effect. If you still get driver resets, make it even larger.\t\t\t\nRecording still images and stop-frame animation can be done by changing the 'Type' parameter. Then the 'Add ' pulse button can be pulsed manually or via a script to cause the frames to be written.\nSee also Movie File In TOP, Recording Movies with Audio.\nmoviefileoutTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  type -  - Output either a movie, image, image sequence, or stop-frame movie.\n\n movie - Records a movie file. image - Records a single image. imagesequence - Records a sequence of images. stopframemovie -\n\n  videocodec -  - Select the video compression codec used to encode the movie.\n\n rle - Run-length encoded video, lossless codec and low decode times, but very large file size.

If this is set to 1 then the main thread will be used to write the image.\n\n\n\n  headerdat - The path to a  that stores header metadata that should be written to the output image or movie file. Header data is written as key-value pairs with the first column storing the keys and the second column storing the associated values. Note: Currently only supported for EXR files. Warning: Files may fail to save if the header data conflicts with system headers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inputs page can be used to add extra channels of image data to the output file and to change the names of the base 4 channels.\nEach 'Additional Input ' is a path to a  containing the image data to add to the file. The associated Red, Green, Blue and Alpha parameters are the names assigned to that input's channels in the new file. If the channel parameter is left blank, that channel will not be added to the output file. Channels with duplicate names will be overwritten.\nNote: Additional inputs are currently only supported in EXR images and sequences. In EXR files, channels are stored in alphabetical order.\n\n  pointcloud - When enabled, an additional header will be added to the file that indicates the contents are point data rather than images.

When this is off recording may start on a later frame, after the file has been opened. Turning this off can avoid a stall in playback, if missing recording some frames at the start is acceptable.\n\n\n\n  profile -  - Select the H.264 profile to use.\n\n autoselect - baseline - main - high -\n\n  preset -  - The H264 preset to use.\n\n none - Select from the available presets. lossless -\n\n  bitratemode -  - Select between Constant or Variable bit rate, and regular or high quality bit rate modes.\n\n constant - variable - constanthq - variablehq -\n\n  avgbitrate - Set the average bitrate target for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  peakbitrate - Set the peak bitrate allowed for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  keyframeinterval - Set the number of frames between key-frames (I-frames) while encoding.\n\n\n\n  maxbframes - Controls the maximum number of B-frames (bi-directional frames) that will be created between pairs of key-frames.\n\n\n\n  motionpredict -  - Controls the quality of the Motion Prediction used when encoding H264/H265.\n\n default - quarter - half - full -\n\n  frameslicing - Controls if H264/H265 frames are sliced into multiple pieces, allowing them to be decoded using multiple CPUs more easily.\n\n\n\n  numslices - The number of slices each frame is split into.\n\n\n\n  entropymode -  - Controls which entropy mode is used for H265 encoding.\n\n autoselect - cabac - cavlc -\n\n  secondarycompression - Hap uses a secondary CPU compression stage usually. Encoding video without this compression will result in faster playback, but potentially larger file sizes (which would require faster drives to play back).\n\n\n\n  encodetestmode - This mode disables file writting, and only does the encoding. This is useful to test the /CPU performance of encoding while taking the SSD speed out of the equation.\n\n\n\n  mipmaps - When saving out .dds file, mipmaps can be included if this is enabled. This is primarily used for the PreFilter Map TOP, which will encode special information into the mipmap levels of the texture which needs to be maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below.

Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A).

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text.

Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nIn the Animation component each keyframe specifies a channel's value at a specific time (or frame). A keyframe holds a value, slopes and accelerations, and an interpolation type. A channel's keyframes are used to interpolate and determine the values of all the samples of the channel.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Movie_File_Out_TOP&oldid=32418\"\n\t\tCategory: TOPs",

      "description": "The Movie File Out  saves a  stream out to a movie file (.mov/.mp4) using a variety of codecs, including the H.264/H.265, Hap Q, NotchLC, Apple ProRes and Animation video codecs. It can also save single frame images, image sequences, or stop-frame movies. \t\t\nFor codecs that support Alpha, use the 'Movie Pixel Format' parameter to select a format that includes alpha.\nThe Export Movie Dialog is a user interface built around the Movie File Out .\t\t\t\nTo record movies with audio using the Movie File Out , a Time Sliced  with mono or stereo channels of audio is required. If TouchDesigner is running at a lower frame rate than the target video frame rate and a  is specified for audio, the Movie File Out  will automatically repeat video frames to ensure the video and audio stay in sync.\t\t\t\nRecording a movie without frame drops can be done in non-realtime by turning off the Realtime flag at the top of the user interface.\t\t\t\t\nThe length of the video is not predetermined and depends on the amount of time the Record parameter is on. \t\nYou can record a sequence of .tif or .exr files by setting the Type parameter to Image Sequence. When Image File Type is set to OpenEXR, the EXR page has options to record any number of color channels from multiple TOPs into an EXR image file, and can create it with metadata that would get read by a Point File In TOP.\nH264/H265 NOTE: Encoding movies in H.264/H.265 codec is only available with a Commercial or Pro license. Nvidia graphic hardware is also required.\t\t\t\n*** WARNING -  Driver Timeout on long  activities *** Encoding some formats at high-resolution may be a slow, -intensive operation. Generally only the RGBA BC7 mode for HapQ can suffer from this though. Consequently it will usually take longer than the default 2 seconds per frame that Windows gives the  driver to complete an operation. If you see a message saying that Windows has reset the  driver, this is the issue you are running into. To fix the issue, create this registry value:\t\t\t\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers\\TdrDelay\t\t\t\nThe value should be of type REG_DWORD. The value is the number of seconds an operation can take before the OS resets the  driver. Set it to something larger, like 20-40 (seconds), depending on the resolution you intend to encode. You must reboot your machine for this setting to take effect. If you still get driver resets, make it even larger.\t\t\t\nRecording still images and stop-frame animation can be done by changing the 'Type' parameter. Then the 'Add ' pulse button can be pulsed manually or via a script to cause the frames to be written.\nSee also Movie File In TOP, Recording Movies with Audio.\nmoviefileoutTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  type -  - Output either a movie, image, image sequence, or stop-frame movie.\n\n movie - Records a movie file. image - Records a single image. imagesequence - Records a sequence of images. stopframemovie -\n\n  videocodec -  - Select the video compression codec used to encode the movie.\n\n rle - Run-length encoded video, lossless codec and low decode times, but very large file size.

Header data is written as key-value pairs with the first column storing the keys and the second column storing the associated values. Note: Currently only supported for EXR files. Warning: Files may fail to save if the header data conflicts with system headers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inputs page can be used to add extra channels of image data to the output file and to change the names of the base 4 channels.\nEach 'Additional Input ' is a path to a  containing the image data to add to the file. The associated Red, Green, Blue and Alpha parameters are the names assigned to that input's channels in the new file. If the channel parameter is left blank, that channel will not be added to the output file. Channels with duplicate names will be overwritten.\nNote: Additional inputs are currently only supported in EXR images and sequences. In EXR files, channels are stored in alphabetical order.\n\n  pointcloud - When enabled, an additional header will be added to the file that indicates the contents are point data rather than images.

When this is off recording may start on a later frame, after the file has been opened. Turning this off can avoid a stall in playback, if missing recording some frames at the start is acceptable.\n\n\n\n  profile -  - Select the H.264 profile to use.\n\n autoselect - baseline - main - high -\n\n  preset -  - The H264 preset to use.\n\n none - Select from the available presets. lossless -\n\n  bitratemode -  - Select between Constant or Variable bit rate, and regular or high quality bit rate modes.\n\n constant - variable - constanthq - variablehq -\n\n  avgbitrate - Set the average bitrate target for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  peakbitrate - Set the peak bitrate allowed for the encoding.\n\n\n\n  keyframeinterval - Set the number of frames between key-frames (I-frames) while encoding.\n\n\n\n  maxbframes - Controls the maximum number of B-frames (bi-directional frames) that will be created between pairs of key-frames.\n\n\n\n  motionpredict -  - Controls the quality of the Motion Prediction used when encoding H264/H265.\n\n default - quarter - half - full -\n\n  frameslicing - Controls if H264/H265 frames are sliced into multiple pieces, allowing them to be decoded using multiple CPUs more easily.\n\n\n\n  numslices - The number of slices each frame is split into.\n\n\n\n  entropymode -  - Controls which entropy mode is used for H265 encoding.\n\n autoselect - cabac - cavlc -\n\n  secondarycompression - Hap uses a secondary CPU compression stage usually. Encoding video without this compression will result in faster playback, but potentially larger file sizes (which would require faster drives to play back).\n\n\n\n  encodetestmode - This mode disables file writting, and only does the encoding. This is useful to test the /CPU performance of encoding while taking the SSD speed out of the equation.\n\n\n\n  mipmaps - When saving out .dds file, mipmaps can be included if this is enabled. This is primarily used for the PreFilter Map TOP, which will encode special information into the mipmap levels of the texture which needs to be maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below.

Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation.

This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation.

Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on.

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text.

Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nIn the Animation component each keyframe specifies a channel's value at a specific time (or frame). A keyframe holds a value, slopes and accelerations, and an interpolation type. A channel's keyframes are used to interpolate and determine the values of all the samples of the channel.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Movie_File_Out_TOP&oldid=32418\"",

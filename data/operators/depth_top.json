The resulting image is black (0) at pixels where the surface is at the near depth value (Camera's parameter \"Near\"). It is white (1) at pixels where the surface is at the far depth value (parameter \"Far\"). \t\t\nThe Depth  is used to do shadow mapping. It can have many other uses also, such as edge detection based on depth. \t\t\t\nThe depth range is by definition the near plane -> far plane. Values in the Depth  will be 0 at the near plane, and 1 at the far plane. Generally the image in the Depth  will be white, unless you have your planes really tight around your object. But just because you can't visually see anything, it doesn't mean the information isn't there. \t\t\t\nAnother option is Linear Camera-Space Depth. If the Render 's Depth Buffer Format is set to 32-Bit Floating- and its Linear Camera-Space Depth parameter is on, then the Depth  will output linear camera space depth.\t\t\t\nYou can use the Level TOP to re-range the Depth 's values. However make sure you set the Pixel Format of the Level  to 16 or 32-bit, or you'll lose a lot of information from the Depth 's data (The Depth  has 24-bit data).\t\t\t\nThe Depth  creates a 24-bit fixed-point or 32-bit floating-point single channel image. When the Depth  is used as an input to another , its data will be treated like an RGBA value of (D, D, D, 1). The same is true when sampling a depth texture in a GLSL shader.\ndepthTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  rendertop - Specifies the Render  used for depth values.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cameraindex - When using Multi-Camera Rendering, chooses which camera's output to select.\n\n\n\t\t\n  peellayerindex - When using the 'Depth-Peeling' feature in the Render TOP, this chooses which peel layer to select.\n\n\n\t\t\n  pixelformat -  - The pixel format the Depth texture should be output as.\n\n depth - rgba8fixed - rgba16float - rgba32float - rgb10a2fixed - rgba16fixed - rgb11 - r8fixed - r16fixed - r16float - r32float - rg8fixed - rg16fixed - rg16float - rg32float - a8fixed - a16float - a32float -\n\t\t\n  depthspace -  - The space the depth values should be output in.\n\n input - The unchanged values the shaders are writing for the depth values.

Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

      "description": "The Depth  reads an image containing depth information from a scene described in a specified Render TOP. The resulting image is black (0) at pixels where the surface is at the near depth value (Camera's parameter \"Near\"). It is white (1) at pixels where the surface is at the far depth value (parameter \"Far\"). \t\t\nThe Depth  is used to do shadow mapping. It can have many other uses also, such as edge detection based on depth. \t\t\t\nThe depth range is by definition the near plane -> far plane. Values in the Depth  will be 0 at the near plane, and 1 at the far plane. Generally the image in the Depth  will be white, unless you have your planes really tight around your object. But just because you can't visually see anything, it doesn't mean the information isn't there. \t\t\t\nAnother option is Linear Camera-Space Depth. If the Render 's Depth Buffer Format is set to 32-Bit Floating- and its Linear Camera-Space Depth parameter is on, then the Depth  will output linear camera space depth.\t\t\t\nYou can use the Level TOP to re-range the Depth 's values. However make sure you set the Pixel Format of the Level  to 16 or 32-bit, or you'll lose a lot of information from the Depth 's data (The Depth  has 24-bit data).\t\t\t\nThe Depth  creates a 24-bit fixed-point or 32-bit floating-point single channel image. When the Depth  is used as an input to another , its data will be treated like an RGBA value of (D, D, D, 1). The same is true when sampling a depth texture in a GLSL shader.\ndepthTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  rendertop - Specifies the Render  used for depth values.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cameraindex - When using Multi-Camera Rendering, chooses which camera's output to select.\n\n\n\t\t\n  peellayerindex - When using the 'Depth-Peeling' feature in the Render TOP, this chooses which peel layer to select.\n\n\n\t\t\n  pixelformat -  - The pixel format the Depth texture should be output as.\n\n depth - rgba8fixed - rgba16float - rgba32float - rgb10a2fixed - rgba16fixed - rgb11 - r8fixed - r16fixed - r16float - r32float - rg8fixed - rg16fixed - rg16float - rg32float - a8fixed - a16float - a32float -\n\t\t\n  depthspace -  - The space the depth values should be output in.\n\n input - The unchanged values the shaders are writing for the depth values. Usually this is a logarithmic curve where 90% of the values are within the closest 10% of the distances to the near plane. cameraspace - Convert the depth values to be in camera space, where 0 is at the camera and it is positive values moving away from the camera. reranged - First convert to camera space values just like the 'Camera Space' mode, but then apply a re-range operation to another custom range.\n\t\t\n  rangefrom -  - The range to convert from when using 'Rerange from Camera Space'. This would often be your area of interest in the camera's depth.\n\nrangefrom1 - The near range to re-range from.rangefrom2 - The far range to re-range from.\n\t\t\n  rangeto -  - The range of values you want to convert the depth values to. This is the range you would find the depth to more useful for processing, often 0-1.\n\nrangeto1 - The near range to re-range to.rangeto2 - The far range to re-range to.\n\t\t\n  clamp - Enable to clamp the depth values between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\t\t\n  gamma - Apply a  gamma curve to the depth values.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

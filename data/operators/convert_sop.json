When selected, the resulting curves retain the same topology as the original polygon. When not selected, the polygon points are used as a hull to define the new curve or surface.\n\n\n\t\t\n  prtype -  - Selects how the particles are rendered.\n\n lines - Each particle will be rendered as a 2-point line, with the length determined based on the particles velocity. If the particle has no velocity it will just be a single pixel in size. pointprites - For use with the Point Sprite MAT. Each particle is a square of pixels that always face the camera. The size of the square is determined by parameters in the  Sprite and the pscale vertex/point attribute. The point sprites will have texture coordinates generated for them automatically also ((0,0) in the bottom left and (1,1) in the top right).\n\n\nFace to Surface Conversion - When converting from a set of polygons to a mesh, a single mesh will result only if Facet SOP.\nOtherwise, each polygon is converted individually into a mesh. In fact, any individual face can be converted to any surface. This is accomplished by cutting the face into three or four adjacent sections, and then creating a patch from them.\n\n\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Convert  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of points in this . - Number of primitives in this . - Number of particles in this . - Time spent in another thread updating geometry data on the  from the 's CPU data.

If the particle has no velocity it will just be a single pixel in size. pointprites - For use with the Point Sprite MAT. Each particle is a square of pixels that always face the camera. The size of the square is determined by parameters in the  Sprite and the pscale vertex/point attribute. The point sprites will have texture coordinates generated for them automatically also ((0,0) in the bottom left and (1,1) in the top right).",

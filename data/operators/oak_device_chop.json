It also implements many of the features of the Timer  such as timer counters, pulses, and custom Python callbacks.\n\n\nBefore starting TouchDesigner, connect any OAK Devices to the computer via USB or Power over Ethernet (PoE). If you connect any devices while TouchDesigner is running, you should pulse the Refresh Device List parameter on the OAK Device . Next, customize the Python createPipeline callback and pulse the start parameter to start the camera. It's ok if you save a project while a camera is running. The camera will know to automatically start when the project opens next time.\n\n\nThe depthai python module has an enum for RGB resolution: dai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution. This enum currently includes THE_1080_P, THE_1200_P, THE_4_K, and many others. These options may not necessarily be compatible with your OAK hardware. The most commonly available RGB resolution is 1080p. You can save on bandwidth by selecting a lower resolution via the ISP scale. Selecting (2, 3) with THE_1080_P will result in a 1280x720 image.\n\n\nThe DepthaiTestSuite project includes several base components which help control settings of an OAK camera by sending messages via an OAK Device . For example, the oakDeviceConfig base enables the user to set the XLinkChunkSize, logging level, and infrared laser settings of a device. The oakCameraControl base helps control RGB camera settings. The oakStereoDepthConfig base helps control stereo depth settings. It is possible to use these configs while the camera is running.\n\n\nLuxonis has a tutorial on low latency. In some cases such as streaming 4K video, you'll want to set XLinkChunkSize to zero. This can be done with the oakDeviceConfig.\nWhen creating depthai pipelines, it's possible to set  targets for various nodes such as the ColorCamera node. In general, the  cannot be changed after the pipeline has been loaded on the camera. You should pick high  values, but keep in mind that if you push these numbers too high, you may see the effective  as shown by an Info  begin to fall.\nSee Also: OAK-D, OAK Select CHOP, OAK Select TOP\noakdeviceCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - \n\n\n\n  sensor - Select the available OAK Device from the dropdown.\n\n\n\n  refreshpulse - Refresh the list of available Sensors.\n\n\n\n  initialize - Initialize is the signal to get the OAK Device into a ready state: The  callback is run and on succesfully concluding will run the  callback.

You can specify a , a stream name, and a sending frequency in Hertz. If the stream name is blank, nothing will be sent. When sending images to the OAK, TouchDesigner will convert the input image to BGR format. This is convenient because most of the neural networks which can be run on the OAK camera expect the input images to be BGR format. If you require the image to be something else, you should use the ImageManip node in your depthai pipeline to change the format.\n\n  stream - Sequence of stream info parameters\n\n\n\n  stream0name - Specify the name of the stream that can receive textures.

In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Device_CHOP&oldid=32289\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

Selecting (2, 3) with THE_1080_P will result in a 1280x720 image.\n\n\nThe DepthaiTestSuite project includes several base components which help control settings of an OAK camera by sending messages via an OAK Device . For example, the oakDeviceConfig base enables the user to set the XLinkChunkSize, logging level, and infrared laser settings of a device. The oakCameraControl base helps control RGB camera settings. The oakStereoDepthConfig base helps control stereo depth settings. It is possible to use these configs while the camera is running.\n\n\nLuxonis has a tutorial on low latency. In some cases such as streaming 4K video, you'll want to set XLinkChunkSize to zero. This can be done with the oakDeviceConfig.\nWhen creating depthai pipelines, it's possible to set  targets for various nodes such as the ColorCamera node. In general, the  cannot be changed after the pipeline has been loaded on the camera. You should pick high  values, but keep in mind that if you push these numbers too high, you may see the effective  as shown by an Info  begin to fall.\nSee Also: OAK-D, OAK Select CHOP, OAK Select TOP\noakdeviceCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - \n\n\n\n  sensor - Select the available OAK Device from the dropdown.\n\n\n\n  refreshpulse - Refresh the list of available Sensors.\n\n\n\n  initialize - Initialize is the signal to get the OAK Device into a ready state: The  callback is run and on succesfully concluding will run the  callback. It indicates that its ready by turning the ready channel on.\n\n\n\n  start - \n\n\n\n  play - The built-in Play parameter can toggle whether or not TouchDesigner processes the new messages it receives from the camera. For example, suppose multiple OAK Select CHOPs or TOPs are connected to the same OAK Device . By toggling play off, you will make all the OAK Select operators continue to receive whatever their most recently received message was, ignoring any new messages.\n\n\n\n  gotodone - \n\n\n\n  callbacks - The path to the  containing callbacks for this OAK Device .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in page named Stream In helps with sending RGBA 8-bit images from TouchDesigner to an OAK camera. You can specify a , a stream name, and a sending frequency in Hertz. If the stream name is blank, nothing will be sent. When sending images to the OAK, TouchDesigner will convert the input image to BGR format. This is convenient because most of the neural networks which can be run on the OAK camera expect the input images to be BGR format. If you require the image to be something else, you should use the ImageManip node in your depthai pipeline to change the format.\n\n  stream - Sequence of stream info parameters\n\n\n\n  stream0name - Specify the name of the stream that can receive textures. The stream needs to be created in the depthai pipeline by creating a XLinkIn node: \n\n\n\n  stream0frequency - Specify the frequency at which a texture is being send to the OAK device.\n\n\n\n  stream0top - Specify the  operator that contains the texture to be send to the stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  outinit - Outputs channel initializing = 1 while the OAK Device is initalizing (i.e. while the callback  returns non-zero).\n\n\n\n  outinitfail - Outputs channel initialize_fail = 1 if the OAK Device ran into an error while initializing or creating the pipeline.\n\n\n\n  outready - Outputs channel ready which is 1 after an Initialize and before a Start.\n\n\n\n  outrunning - Outputs channel running which is 1 after a Start and before the Done.\n\n\n\n  outdone - Outputs channel done = 1 when done or complete.\n\n\n\n  outtimercount -  - \n\n off - seconds - frames - samples - all -\n\n  outrunningcount -  - Outputs the \"wall-clock\" time since Start occurred, no matter if the device's Play parameter was turned off or not. Will stop counting when the Done state has been reached.\n\n off - seconds - frames - samples - all -\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter.

Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Device_CHOP&oldid=32289\"",

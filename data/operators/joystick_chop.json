You can have several devices attached, and any number of Joystick CHOPs in a project per device.\t\t\t\nBefore you use the game controller on your computer, calibrate them using Start -> Settings ->  -> Gaming Options -> Properties.\t\t\t\nThe main two outputs, the X-axis and Y-axis are output through channels called xaxis and yaxis. The other four axes are output through channels with similar names.\t\t\t\nThe range of the values for each channel is 0 to 1. For any axis, a value 0.5 is considered \"centered\". A value of 0 is given if the axis doesn't exist.\t\t\t\nFor any button, a value of 0 means the button is up or doesn't exist. A value of 1 means the button is pressed.\t\t\t\nPOV Hats behave like an X and Y axis. A POV axis only has 3 values though, 0, 0.5 and 1.\njoystickCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - While on, the  receives information from joysticks and gamepads.

Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Joystick_CHOP&oldid=26714\"",

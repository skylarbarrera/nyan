The primary Kinect Azure TOP must also be active to receive data.\n\n\n\n  top - The name of the primary Kinect Azure TOP that is configuring the camera. The primary  controls which camera the select  receives data from, as well as all device configuration such as resolution, framerate, etc.\n\n\n\n  image -  - A list of available image types to capture from the device and display in this . All image types have a second version that is mapped (aligned) to the image space of the other camera so that color and depth image data can be matched. The resolution of the image is controlled by the Color  or Depth Mode parameters of the primary Kinect Azure TOP.\n\n color - An 8-bit RGBA image from the color camera. colorremap - The color camera image remapped to align with the current depth camera image. The resolution is determined by the Depth Mode. depth - A single channel 32-bit floating point depth image where pixel values measure the distance in meters from the camera.  and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode parameter. depthremap - The depth image remapped to align with the current color camera image. The resolution is determined by the Color . ir - A 16-bit integer infrared image captured by the depth camera.  and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode. irremap - The infrared image remapped to align the current color camera image. The resolution is determined by the Color  parameter. playerindex - An 8-bit single channel image that maps pixels to players that have been identified by the body tracking system. Pixel values represent the body id multiplied by 25 to improve contrast. Note: The player index map may have additional hardware requirements (CUDA capable graphics card) and may not synchronize with the color or depth images depending on current settings. The resolution is determined by the current Depth Mode. playerindexremap - The player index map remapped to align with the current color image. The resolution is determined by the Color  parameter. pointcloud - A 32bit floating point RGBA image where the depth information has been converted into XYZ positions that are stored in the RGB channels. Position data is represented in meters and the resolution and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode. The  Cloud image can be viewed in 3D by activating the  and selecting 'View as Points' in the right-click menu, or by using the  as an instance source in the Geometry . pointcloudremap - The point cloud image remapped to align with the current color image. Note: Remapping the image can create gaps and artifacts when view the points in 3D.\n\n  remapimage - When enabled, the current image will be remapped to align with images from the other camera. For example, use this feature to create a color camera image that maps to the pixels of the depth camera. The current depth mode and color resolution will be used to do the remapping. Note: Remapping the point cloud image can create artifacts in the distribution of points due to gaps in the remapping algorithm.\n\n\n\n  bodyimage - When enabled, the image produced will be delayed so that it corresponds to the most recent data from the body tracking system.\n\n\n\n  mirrorimage - Flip the image in the horizontal axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

      "description": "NOTE\n\nOS: This operator is only supported under the Microsoft Windows 10 April 2018 or newer operating system.\n\n\nThe Kinect Azure Select  can be used to capture additional images from a Microsoft Kinect Azure or Kinect compatible Orbbec camera that is controlled by a Kinect Azure TOP.\nThis  must be used along with a Kinect Azure TOP.\nkinectazureselectTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Controls whether this  is retrieving image data from the device. The primary Kinect Azure TOP must also be active to receive data.\n\n\n\n  top - The name of the primary Kinect Azure TOP that is configuring the camera. The primary  controls which camera the select  receives data from, as well as all device configuration such as resolution, framerate, etc.\n\n\n\n  image -  - A list of available image types to capture from the device and display in this . All image types have a second version that is mapped (aligned) to the image space of the other camera so that color and depth image data can be matched. The resolution of the image is controlled by the Color  or Depth Mode parameters of the primary Kinect Azure TOP.\n\n color - An 8-bit RGBA image from the color camera. colorremap - The color camera image remapped to align with the current depth camera image. The resolution is determined by the Depth Mode. depth - A single channel 32-bit floating point depth image where pixel values measure the distance in meters from the camera.  and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode parameter. depthremap - The depth image remapped to align with the current color camera image. The resolution is determined by the Color . ir - A 16-bit integer infrared image captured by the depth camera.  and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode. irremap - The infrared image remapped to align the current color camera image. The resolution is determined by the Color  parameter. playerindex - An 8-bit single channel image that maps pixels to players that have been identified by the body tracking system. Pixel values represent the body id multiplied by 25 to improve contrast. Note: The player index map may have additional hardware requirements (CUDA capable graphics card) and may not synchronize with the color or depth images depending on current settings. The resolution is determined by the current Depth Mode. playerindexremap - The player index map remapped to align with the current color image. The resolution is determined by the Color  parameter. pointcloud - A 32bit floating point RGBA image where the depth information has been converted into XYZ positions that are stored in the RGB channels. Position data is represented in meters and the resolution and field of view are determined by the Depth Mode. The  Cloud image can be viewed in 3D by activating the  and selecting 'View as Points' in the right-click menu, or by using the  as an instance source in the Geometry . pointcloudremap - The point cloud image remapped to align with the current color image. Note: Remapping the image can create gaps and artifacts when view the points in 3D.\n\n  remapimage - When enabled, the current image will be remapped to align with images from the other camera. For example, use this feature to create a color camera image that maps to the pixels of the depth camera. The current depth mode and color resolution will be used to do the remapping. Note: Remapping the point cloud image can create artifacts in the distribution of points due to gaps in the remapping algorithm.\n\n\n\n  bodyimage - When enabled, the image produced will be delayed so that it corresponds to the most recent data from the body tracking system.\n\n\n\n  mirrorimage - Flip the image in the horizontal axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Kinect Azure Select  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2023.112802021.100002020.20000before 2020.20000\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.

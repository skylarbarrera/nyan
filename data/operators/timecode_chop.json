A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated.

In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1.

      "description": "The Timecode  generates Timecode data (channels, a .timecode python object and other python members). Its Mode menu provides a variety of ways to get, set and generate timecode through its parameters, including being driven from a timecode string, a set of channels, or other OPs that have timecode such as video input devices. You can also set timecode with python functions.\nThe timecode data is output as both channel data in the , and as a Timecode object via its .timecode member in Python.\nThe timecode can follow the SMPTE standard (ie. non-negative, frames-per-second up to 60, loops at 24 hours), or a more general format (ie. any number of frames per second, negative timecode allowed, loops at 100 hours).\nWhen being driven by channels, an input with channels named negative, hour, minute, second, or frame can be provided that is added to the Timecode 's output.\nSee also: Timecode, Timecode Class and the OP  for the Timecode .\ntimecodeCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  smpte - When enabled the generated timecode will follow the SMPTE timecode standard, meaning no negative timecodes, and the timecode will loop at 24 hours. When disabled, the format will be more general, allowing for negative numbers and a maximum timecode of 100 hours.\n\n\n\n  mode -  - The source used for generating the timecode\n\n lockedtotimeline - Generates the timecode from the timeline's time. specifyindex - Generates the timecode from a single index value. timecodestr - Generates the timecode from a timecode string following the format: hh:mm:ss:ff or hh:mm:ss.ff timecodepar - Generates the timecode from hour, minute, second, and frame parameters. The parameters will overflow from one to the next, eg. specifying 120 seconds will output timecode as 00:02:00:00. Fractional values are also allowed. sequential - The timecode increases sequentially over time. timecodeobj - Generates the timecode from a timecode object. chop - Generates the timecode from a  reference with some or all of the channels: negative, hour, minute, second, frame. op - Generates the timecode from an OP with a timecode Python member, eg. MoviefileinTOP_Class.\n\n  rate - The timecode . The timecode's max frame value is equal to rate-1. If a fractional rate is provided then the rate is rounded up to the nearest whole number and drop-frames will be calculated if enabled on the Drop Frame parameter.\n\n\n\n  dropframe -  - Specify how to calculate drop-frames. Drop frames are used when the  is fractional.  cannot increment a fractional amount per frame so  is rounded to the next whole number and the accumulation of error is accommodated for by adding drop frames.\n\n off - Drop-frames will not added. auto - Drop-frames will be added to the timecode when the rate is fractional. For special rate values such as 29.97, the defined standard solution is used (ie. 2 frames added every minute, except minutes that are divisible by 10). In other cases, a general solution is used by calculating the accumulated error.\n\n  index - The index used to generate the timecode. Value is used in conjunction with the specified units.\n\n\n\n  indexunit -  - The index value units.\n\n indices - frames - seconds -\n\n  timecodestr - A timecode string following the format: hh:mm:ss:ff or hh:mm:ss.ff\n\n\n\n  frame - Frame component of the timecode.\n\n\n\n  second - Second component of the timecode.\n\n\n\n  minute - Minute component of the timecode. Allows for overflow.\n\n\n\n  hour - Hour component of the timecode.\n\n\n\n  init - Used in sequential mode. Initializes the timecode value.\n\n\n\n  start - Used in sequential mode. Starts the timecode sequential increment.\n\n\n\n  play - When enabled, the sequential timecode will step forward.\n\n\n\n  timecodeobj - A timecode object.\n\n\n\n  chop - A  reference which contains some or all of the following channels: negative, hour, minute, second, frame.\n\n\n\n  op - An OP reference that contains a timecode Python member: eg. MoviefileinTOP_Class.\n\n\n\n  customlength - When enabled, a custom length can be specified for the timecode. If not, the default length will be 23:59:59:ff-1 for a SMPTE timecode and 99:59:59:ff-1 otherwise.\n\n\n\n  length - Specifies the custom length in either samples, frames, or seconds. If it is desired to reference a Timecode Object then either tdu.Timecode().totalSeconds or tdu.Timecode().totalFrames, depending on the unit value.\n\n\n\n  lengthunits -  - The unit of the custom length.\n\n samples - frames - seconds -\n\n  cycle - When enabled, the timecode value will cycle back to 00:00:00:00 upon reaching the custom length, rather than holding the last value.\n\n\n\n\n\n  negativechan - When enabled, outputs the negative channel, which is true when the timecode is negative. Always false when using SMPTE standard.\n\n\n\n  framechan - When enabled, outputs the frame channel.\n\n\n\n  secondchan - When enabled, outputs the second channel.\n\n\n\n  minutechan - When enabled, outputs the minute channel.\n\n\n\n  hourchan - When enabled, outputs the hour channel.\n\n\n\n  totalseconds - When enabled, outputs the total_seconds channel, which is the timecode converted into seconds.\n\n\n\n  totalframes - When enabled, outputs the total_frames channel, which is the timecode into frames.\n\n\n\n  dropframechan - When enabled, outputs the drop_frame channel, which is true when the timecode is drop-frame.\n\n\n\n  fpschan - When enabled, outputs the fps channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n - Optional input  with some or all of following channels: negative, hour, minute, second, frame. The input timecode value is added to the Timecode 's output.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2023.11280\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nOP Snippets  is a set of 700+ live examples of TouchDesigner operators. You can access snippets via the Help menu, or by right-clicking on network operators, or r-clicking on OP Create dialog items.\n\n\n\nThe panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping Time your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Timecode_CHOP&oldid=30631\"",

Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm. \nIf a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.\nIf a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint . Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.\nIf a slider constraint is applied to a single body, then that body's translation/rotation will be constrained to just that axis. In other words, the body can only move along that axis (either direction) and can only rotate along that axis (either direction).\nSee also: Bullet Dynamics, Bullet Solver COMP, Actor COMP, Force COMP, Impulse Force COMP, Bullet Solver CHOP.\nconstraintCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Toggle the constraint on/off in the simulation.\n\n\n\n  type -  - The type of constraint to create: point to point, hinge, or slider.\n\n p2p - hinge - slider -\n\n  bodytobody - Toggle body to body mode on/off. Body to body mode creates a constraint between two bodies (Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies). When toggled off it will create constrain bodies individually. If Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies contain the same number of referenced bodies, then this mode will create a constraint between each respective pair. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\", and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4 5\" then this will create 3 constraints: 0->3, 1->4, 2->5. It is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two parameters. However, if Actor 1 Bodies has more bodies than Actor 2 Bodies, then the remaining \"unmatched\" bodies of Actor 1 Bodies will instead be individually constrained. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\" and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4\", then two constraints will be created between bodies: 0->3, 1->4. Body 2 will be constrained individually. If Actor 2 Bodies contains more bodies than Actor 1 Bodies, then any unmatched bodies in Actor 2 Bodies will simply be disregarded (no constraint created for them).\n\n\n\n  collisions - Turns on/off collisions between the body to body constraints.\n\n\n\n  dispcom - Turns on/off the display of the constraint guide in the viewer.\n\n\n\n  actor1 - A reference to an Actor .

Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm. \nIf a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).

      "description": "A Constraint  is used to restrict the movement of the bodies in a set of Actor COMPs. Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm. \nIf a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.\nIf a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint . Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.\nIf a slider constraint is applied to a single body, then that body's translation/rotation will be constrained to just that axis. In other words, the body can only move along that axis (either direction) and can only rotate along that axis (either direction).\nSee also: Bullet Dynamics, Bullet Solver COMP, Actor COMP, Force COMP, Impulse Force COMP, Bullet Solver CHOP.\nconstraintCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Toggle the constraint on/off in the simulation.\n\n\n\n  type -  - The type of constraint to create: point to point, hinge, or slider.\n\n p2p - hinge - slider -\n\n  bodytobody - Toggle body to body mode on/off. Body to body mode creates a constraint between two bodies (Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies). When toggled off it will create constrain bodies individually. If Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies contain the same number of referenced bodies, then this mode will create a constraint between each respective pair. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\", and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4 5\" then this will create 3 constraints: 0->3, 1->4, 2->5. It is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two parameters. However, if Actor 1 Bodies has more bodies than Actor 2 Bodies, then the remaining \"unmatched\" bodies of Actor 1 Bodies will instead be individually constrained. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\" and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4\", then two constraints will be created between bodies: 0->3, 1->4. Body 2 will be constrained individually. If Actor 2 Bodies contains more bodies than Actor 1 Bodies, then any unmatched bodies in Actor 2 Bodies will simply be disregarded (no constraint created for them).\n\n\n\n  collisions - Turns on/off collisions between the body to body constraints.\n\n\n\n  dispcom - Turns on/off the display of the constraint guide in the viewer.\n\n\n\n  actor1 - A reference to an Actor .

For example, to spin around the Z axis set to 0, 0, 1.\n\n axis2x - axis2y - axis2z -\n\n  sliderrot2 -  - The rotation of the slider constraint axis. By default the slider constraint is applied on the X axis.\n\n sliderrot2x - sliderrot2y - sliderrot2z -\n\n\n\n  enablelimits - Enables limits on the constraint.

Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a .

For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Constraint  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2022.241402021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

When toggled off it will create constrain bodies individually. If Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies contain the same number of referenced bodies, then this mode will create a constraint between each respective pair. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\", and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4 5\" then this will create 3 constraints: 0->3, 1->4, 2->5. It is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two parameters. However, if Actor 1 Bodies has more bodies than Actor 2 Bodies, then the remaining \"unmatched\" bodies of Actor 1 Bodies will instead be individually constrained. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string \"0 1 2\" and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string \"3 4\", then two constraints will be created between bodies: 0->3, 1->4. Body 2 will be constrained individually. If Actor 2 Bodies contains more bodies than Actor 1 Bodies, then any unmatched bodies in Actor 2 Bodies will simply be disregarded (no constraint created for them).",

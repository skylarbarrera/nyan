In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in Bullet this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.  \nThe resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as the Force COMP with the same values if the Force  is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of Impulse Force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg * 1sec = 2m/s. \nSee also: Bullet Dynamics, Bullet Solver COMP, Actor COMP, Force COMP, Constraint COMP, Bullet Solver CHOP.\nimpulseforceCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  pulse -  for the impulse force.

Having a nonzero relative position will also cause the body to rotate due to added torque.\n\n relposx - relposy - relposz -\n\n  torque -  - The rotational force in Newtons that will be applied.\n\n torquex - torquey - torquez -\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  keepmemory - Used only for Panel Components this keeps the panel in memory to it doesn't reload every time it is displayed.\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadtoxonstart - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  reinitnet - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present), followed by re-initializing itself from its master, if it's a clone.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadtoxonstart - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  reinitnet - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present), followed by re-initializing itself from its master, if it's a clone.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nEvery component contains a network of operators that create and modify data. The operators are connected by wires that define where data is routed after the operator cooks its inputs and generates an output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Impulse_Force_COMP&oldid=23584\"",

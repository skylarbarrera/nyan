In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Device_Out_CHOP&oldid=24453\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

Its default is .2 seconds set in Edit -> Preferences -> CHOPs -> Maximum  Size). If any frame takes longer than the Maximum  Size time to draw, audio will pop.\nThen the audio buffer size can be increased (the Buffer Length parameter defaults to .15 seconds) up to the Maximum  Size.\nOptimize your networks so under no condition your frame time exceeds the audio buffer size or the maximum time slice size. You can monitor this precisely with the Perform CHOP.\nPut audio in a separate TouchDesigner process.audiodeviceoutCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Turns the audio output on or off.\n\n\n\t\t\n  driver -  - Select between default DirectSound/CoreAudio or ASIO drivers.\n\n default - The default Windows audio driver (a.k.a. WDM) or macOS CoreAudio driver, depending on your OS. asio - Low-latency drivers which usually come from the hardware's manufacturer.\n\t\t\n  device - A menu of available audio devices to output to.

Audio output is delayed by this amount. For example, if the Buffer Length is 0.25 then the sound will occur 250ms = 0.25 seconds later than this  received it (to keep the buffer full). If you hear crackling or popping in the audio output, try increasing this value.\n\n\n\t\t\n  volume - 0 = mute, 1 = full volume.\n\n\n\t\t\n  pan - 0 = left, 0.5 = centered, 1 = right.\n\n\n\t\t\n  clampoutput - Clamps the output between -1 and 1 to avoid clipping and overdriving of the audio system.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cookalways - Forces the  to cook every frame.

It can be turned off when the  is not in use.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using DirectSound on Windows, outputs on this page and the following  page are for routing to an audio device's different speaker outputs. Not all devices will support all outputs.\t\t\nWhen the Audio Device Out  has multiple input channels, the channels are applied to the checked speaker outputs in order. The first input channel is output to the first speaker checked, the second input channel is output to the second speaker checked, and so on.\t\t\t\nThe following speaker outputs are found on this parameter page:\n\n  stereo - Set to simple stereo left/right output mode.\n\n\n\n  frontleft - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontright - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lowfrequency - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backleft - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backright - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontleftcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontrightcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following speaker outputs are found on this parameter page:\n\n  sideleft - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  sideright - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontleft - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontright - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackleft - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackcenter - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackright - Enable this output if available.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter.

In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Device_Out_CHOP&oldid=24453\"",

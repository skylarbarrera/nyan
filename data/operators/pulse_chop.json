A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP.

In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Pulse_CHOP&oldid=32290\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

The amplitude of each pulse can be edited with the  sliders or with handles on the graph.\t\t\nThe   gives a set of pulses in a static channel of a specifiable length. \t\t\t\nSee also the LFO CHOP to get an endless stream of pulses that is Time Sliced, and the Pattern CHOP for a string of static pulses.\t\t\t\nThe   can be used as triggers to the Copy CHOP, and can represent regularly-timed events.\t\t\t\nBy default, the pulses are a single sample long, but you can increase the  Width so that the pulses are steps to the next pulse. You can also interpolate the values between pulses, as Linear, Ease In Ease Out, Cubic or other curves.\t\t\t\nThe pulses can be restricted to a minimum / maximum limit. If the Limit Type is Clamp, the graph has additional convenient handles at the minimum and maximum for each pulse.\t\t\t\nThe   generates a single channel, and you can merge several  CHOPs into a multi-channel .\t\t\t\nThe   uses its optional first input as a start/end reference, so a number of  CHOPs can be stretched to the same interval.\nThe optional second input is used to specify pulses at specific sample locations. Every single-sampel input channel is then interpreted as the location of a pulse.\nIn order to set the value at the last sample, the option, Last  at Last Sample is provided. Otherwise, the last pulse is prior to the last sample.\npulseCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  number - The number of pulses to generate.\n\n\n\n  interp -  - You can interpolate the values between pulses using the following function curves:\n\n nointerp - Disables interpolation. linear - Use linear interpolation between samples when the interval is lengthened. Averages all samples near the new sample when the interval is shortened. easein - Uses an easein() function for blending. easeout - Uses an easeout() function for blending. cosine - Uses both easein() and easeout() functions. cubic - Cubically interpolates between samples, for smoother curves than Linear. This method is not recommended for channels with sharp changes. connect - Instead of the pulses returning to 0, the pulse value is held until the pulse.\n\n  width - By default, the pulses are a single sample long, but you can increase the  Width so that the pulses are steps to the next pulse.\n\n\n\n  widthunit -  - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.\n\n samples - frames - seconds -\n\n  limit -  - Enable the Minimum and Maximum clamping values below with this menu.\n\n nolimit - Pulses are allowed to be any value with no clamping. clamp - Clamps pulse values to the Minimum and Maximum values specified below.\n\n  min - The pulses can be restricted to a Minimum limit.

A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Pulse_CHOP&oldid=32290\"",

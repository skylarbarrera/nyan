When the input type is set to 'Vector', translations are ignored and only rotation and scaling operations are performed. The alpha channel, if present, is passed along to the output image unchanged.\nTransformations can be defined directly on the Transform page, taken from an input  (see Transform CHOP), using the Look At parameter, or as a combination of any of those methods.\nThe Align page allows you to move or scale the point cloud relative to the origin, a 1x1x1 cube, or to a reference object. For example, you can scale the cloud to fit inside another point cloud or piece of geometry, or you can align the point cloud to sit on the XZ plane, or directly beside another cloud.\nThe second input can optionally be used as a weight map to control how much of the transformation is applied to each individual point.\npointtransformTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  inputtype -  - Choose if the RGB channels of the input texture should be treated as positions or vectors. Vectors will not have the translation portion of the transform applied to them, and can be normalized before and/or after the transformation is applied.\n\n position - The RGB values represent XYZ positions. vector - The RGB values represent XYZ directions.\n\n  innormalize - RGB input vectors are rescaled to a length of one before they are transformed.\n\n\n\n  outnormalize - RGB vectors are rescaled to a length of one after they are transformed.\n\n\n\n  xord -  - Changes the order that the translate, rotate and scale operations are performed on the input. Analogous to how you would end up in different locations if you were to move a block and turn east, versus turning east and then moving a block.  In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  t -  - Move the input positions in the X, Y and Z axes. If the input is set to 'Vector', the translate values will have no effect.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Rotate the input RGB values around the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. Angles are given in degrees.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - Scale the input RGB values in the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. If 'Normalize Output' is on, then all output values will be rescaled to a length of one regardless of the scale values.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The pivot is the point about which the input points or vectors are scaled and rotated. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the object.\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - Scale the input values along all axes simultaneously.\n\n\n\n  invert - Invert the transformation i.e. preform the reverse movements.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient your input points by naming the object you would like them to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this object to look at, it will continue to face that object, even if you move it.\n\n\n\n  upvector -  - When orienting an object towards the 'Look At' target, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upvectorx - upvectory - upvectorz -\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  chopinput -  to a  node with channels describing a 3D transformation. These channels may come from a Transform CHOP or another  with the correct channels defined.\n\n\n\n  multiplyorder -  - Controls whether the transformation from the given  is applied to the input values before or after the transformation describe by this node.\n\n inputxformpage - xformpageinput -\n\n\n\n  weightchannel -  - Select how to use the colors of the second input image as weights for transforming the points of the first input.\n\n luminance - red - green - blue - alpha - rgbaverage - average - rgbmax - max - independent -\n\n  weightrange -  - Set the range of weight values used to control how much of the transformation is applied to a point. Points with the minimum weight will not be transformed, while points with the maximum weight will be fully transformed. A linear interpolation is applied to points with weights that fall between the minimum and maximum.\n\n weightrange1 - weightrange2 -\n\n\n\nThese operations allow you to align the input points to the origin or to another reference object before or after the transformation has been applied. For example, you can recenter the transformed point cloud on the origin or position it directly next to another point cloud. Note: Align operations incur additional performance costs because they must calculate the dimensions of all points in the input.\n\n  alignxformorder -  - Determines the order that align operations are performed on the input points. Note: Unlike Scaling on the transform page, the alignment scale is always done relative to the center of the point cloud so that the point cloud's center does not change.\n\n transformalign - aligntransform -\n\n  alignref - A path to a  or  node used to align the input points after the transformation. Note Using another point cloud  as a reference will incur additional performance costs because of the need to calculate the dimensions of the reference points.\n\n\n\n  alignopord -  - Set the order in which scale and transform is applied when aligning.\n\n st - ts -\n\n  aligntx -  - Determines the final position of points along the X axis i.e. shifts values in the red channel.\n\n off - X values are not moved. origin - X values are aligned relative to the origin i.e. zero. reference - X values are aligned relative to the X position of the reference node.\n\n  fromx -  - Determines how the points are aligned relative to the dimensions of the input points.\n\n min - Points are aligned relative to the lowest X value. center - Points are aligned relative to the center of the X values. max - Points are aligned relative to the highest X value.\n\n  tox -  - Determines how the final points are aligned relative to the reference node.\n\n min - Points are aligned with the lowest X value in the reference node. center - Points are aligned with the center of the X values in the reference node. max - Points are aligned with the highest X value in the reference node.\n\n  alignty -  - Determines the final position of points along the Y axis i.e. shifts values in the green channel.\n\n off - Y values are not moved. origin - Y values are aligned relative to the origin i.e. zero. reference - Y values are aligned relative to the X position of the reference node.\n\n  fromy -  - Determines how the points are aligned relative to the dimensions of the input points.\n\n min - Points are aligned relative to the lowest Y value. center - Points are aligned relative to the center of the Y values. max - Points are aligned relative to the highest Y value.\n\n  toy -  - Determines how the final points are aligned relative to the reference node.\n\n min - Points are aligned with the lowest Y value in the reference node. center - Points are aligned with the center of the Y values in the reference node. max - Points are aligned with the highest Y value in the reference node.\n\n  aligntz -  - Determines the final position of points along the Z axis i.e. shifts values in the blue channel.\n\n off - Z values are not moved. origin - Z values are aligned relative to the origin i.e. zero. reference - Z values are aligned relative to the X position of the reference node.\n\n  fromz -  - Determines how the points are aligned relative to the dimensions of the input points.\n\n min - Points are aligned relative to the lowest Z value. center - Points are aligned relative to the center of the Z values. max - Points are aligned relative to the highest Z value.\n\n  toz -  - Determines how the final points are aligned relative to the reference node.\n\n min - Points are aligned relative to the lowest Z value. center - Points are aligned relative to the center of the Z values. max - Points are aligned relative to the highest Z value.\n\n  alignscale -  - The Align Scale can be used to resize the point cloud to fit inside the given bounds. Scaling can be done per axis (maintaining proportions or stretching), or on all axes.\n\n peraxis - Scaling is controlled separately per-axis using the parameters below. Note: It is possible to have conflicting scales when setting limits on multiple axes. unity - The point cloud is resized to fit within a 1x1x1 cube. Proportions are maintained so that the largest dimension will have a length of 1. reference - The point cloud is resized to fit within the dimensions of the reference object. Proportions are maintained.\n\n  alignscalex -  - The point cloud is resized based on its width in the X axis.\n\n off - No scaling is done based on the X axis. unity - The point cloud is resized along the X axis so that the total width is 1. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud. reference - The point cloud is resized along the X axis to the width of the reference object. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud. unityprop - The point cloud is resized so that the total width in the X axis is 1.

The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation.

This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process.

      "description": "The  Transform  treats the RGB values of the input image as a point cloud of XYZ positions or vectors and performs 3D transformations and alignments. When the input type is set to 'Vector', translations are ignored and only rotation and scaling operations are performed. The alpha channel, if present, is passed along to the output image unchanged.\nTransformations can be defined directly on the Transform page, taken from an input  (see Transform CHOP), using the Look At parameter, or as a combination of any of those methods.\nThe Align page allows you to move or scale the point cloud relative to the origin, a 1x1x1 cube, or to a reference object. For example, you can scale the cloud to fit inside another point cloud or piece of geometry, or you can align the point cloud to sit on the XZ plane, or directly beside another cloud.\nThe second input can optionally be used as a weight map to control how much of the transformation is applied to each individual point.\npointtransformTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  inputtype -  - Choose if the RGB channels of the input texture should be treated as positions or vectors.

Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Point_Transform_TOP&oldid=29948\"",

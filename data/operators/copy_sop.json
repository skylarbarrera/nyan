Stamped parameters are accessible via the global  method in the td Module in python, or param() in tscript.

The template attribute can modify the source in four ways:\t\t\n\nSet - Override the source attribute.\nMultiply - Multiply the source attribute.\nAdd - Get Added to the source attribute.\nSub - Get Subtracted from the source attribute.The template point attributes are able to affect point, primitive, or vertex attributes in the source geometry simply by entering values in the appropriate fields.\n\n  doattr - Enables the parameters below to allow template point attributes to be applied to the copied source geometry.\n\n\n\n  setpt -  - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's points.\n\n * -\n\n  setprim -  - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's primitives.\n\n * -\n\n  setvtx -  - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's vertices.\n\n * -\n\n  mulpt -  - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's point attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  mulprim -  - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's primitive attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  mulvtx -  - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's vertex attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  addpt -  - Add the attributes to the source geometry's point attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  addprim -  - Add the attributes to the source geometry's primitive attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  addvtx -  - Add the attributes to the source geometry's vertex attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  subpt -  - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's point attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  subprim -  - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's primitive attributes.\n\n * -\n\n  subvtx -  - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's vertex attributes.\n\n * -\n\n\n\nYou can use the me.copyTotal python member to calculate the degrees of rotation for a given number of copies. For example, if you have 28 copies, you can set the rotation to be: 360/me.copyTotal - this would automatically give you 12.8571 degrees, evenly spacing your 28 copies around the full circumference of the circle.\nUsing a Particle  as the Template object, you can copy objects defined in the Copy Data input to each particle template. This allows you, for example, to copy a Bee to each particle to create a swarm of bees.\nMake a series of copies about an axis, and skin them to achieve lathe-like effects, similar to the results achieved with the Revolve .\n\n\n\nPlace a Circle , and set its type to .\nSet the number of Divisions in the Circle to:  The method  returns the value of the global parameter sides. If it is not yet defined it will return a value of 3.\nAppend a Copy , and set the Number of Copies to 5; and set Translate X to: 2.5 .\nIn the Stamp page of the Copy , turn on Stamp Inputs. Set Param 1 to: sides and \nThis creates a triangle on the first stamped copy; a square on the next; a pentagon on the third, and so on. The geometry for each copy is cooked separately.\nYou can set multiple stamp Params at once and they can be used anywhere in the ancestry of the copy's input.\n\n\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Copy  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of points in this . - Number of primitives in this . - Number of particles in this . - Time spent in another thread updating geometry data on the  from the 's CPU data.

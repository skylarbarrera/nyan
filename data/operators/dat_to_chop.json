You can check Regular Expression Operations for additional information on how to use the Python Regular  module.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fromcol - When selecting rows by values, this parameter selects which column to use when matching cell values to Selected Row Values to determine which rows are selected.\n\n\n\t\t\n  extractcols -  - This parameter allows you to pick different ways of specifying the columns selected.\n\n all - All columns selected. byname - Columns selected using Start Col Name and End Col Name parameters. byindex - Columns selected using Start Col Index and End Col Index parameters. bynameindex - Columns selected using Start Col Name and End Col Index parameters. byindexname - Columns selected using Start Col Index and End Col Name parameters. bynames - Columns selected by specifying the column values explicitly. byexpr - Rows selected by an expression to be evaluated for the from row.\n\t\t\n  colnamestart - Specify the column name to start the selection range from.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colindexstart - Specify the column index to start the selection range from.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colnameend - Specify the column name to end the selection range.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colindexend - Specify the column index to end the selection range.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colnames - Specify actual column names that you want to select.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA text string that contains data (string, float, list, boolean, etc.) and operators (+ * < etc) that are evaluated by the node's language (python or Tscript) and returns a string, float list or boolean, etc. Expressions are used in parameters, DATs and in scripts.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT_to_CHOP&oldid=24022\"",

If you want to match the parent's operator name followed by any numeric number you can use parent().name+'[0-9]*', where '[0-9]*' matches any numerical string. '.*'+parent().name+'.*' will match any cell that contains the operator's parent name. You can check Regular Expression Operations for additional information on how to use the Python Regular  module.",

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Cache_TOP&oldid=23870\"\n\t\tCategory: TOPs",

These cached images can be read by the graphics card much faster than an image cache in main memory or reading images off disk. \t\nThe Cache  can be used to freeze images in the  by turning the Active parameter Off. (You can set the cache size too 1.)\t\t\nThe Cache  acts as a delay if you set Output Index to negative numbers and leave the Active parameter On.\t\t\nOnce a sequence of images has been captured by turning the Active parameter On or toggling the Active  parameter, they can be looped by animating the Output Index parameter.\ncacheTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - While this is On, the Cache  will capture images into its memory.\n\n\n\t\n  activepulse - Captures an image for the single frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\n  cacheonce - Checking this On will cook the  once after startup to load an initial image.\n\n\n\t\n  replace - While this is On, the Cache  will replace the image at 'Replace Index' with the input image. This allows you to replace specific images in the cache at will.\n\n\n\t\n  replacespulse - Replace an image for the single frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\n  replaceindex - Select the image index that will be replaced by the input, when 'Replace Single' is turned on.\n\n\n\t\n  prefill - Cooks 'Cache Size' number of times to fill the Cache  with images. When set to 1, it will fill the cache. If set to 1 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set to 1 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. While this is > 0, the node behaves as if the Active parameter is Off. If set to 0, then back > 0, it will clear the previous data, and pre-fill again. For more information refer to the Pre-Filling article.\n\n\n\t\n  prefillpulse - Pre-fills a single image during the frame this was pulsed.\n\n\n\t\n  cachesize - Determines the number of images that can be stored in this Cache .\n\n\n\t\n  step - The number of cooks that go by before the Cache  grabs an image. A Step Size of 2 will cache an image every 2nd cook, a Step Size of 3 will cache every 3rd cook, and so on.\n\n\n\t\n  outputindex - Determines which image in cache the  outputs. 0 is the most recent image, negative integers output image further back in time.\n\n\n\t\n  outputindexunit - Sets the units used in the Output Index parameter.\n\n\n\t\n  interp - When On (On = 1), the Cache  will interpolate between frames when non-integer values are used in the Output Index parameter. For example, a value of -0.5 in Output Index will output a blended image of the most recent frame (0.0) and the second most recent frame (-1.0).\n\n\n\t\n  alwayscook - Forces the operator to cook every frame.\n\n\n\t\n  reset - While On this will empty the cache of stored images and release the memory held by the .\n\n\n\t\n  resetpulse - Instantly empty the cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A).

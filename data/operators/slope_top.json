      "description": "The Slope  generates pixels that represent the difference between its value and its neighbouring pixels' values. Given that default RGBA pixel values are between 0 and 1, the value of .5 means the neighbor's values are the same as the pixel's value. Values output in the red channel that are above .5 indicate the values are increasing left-to-right. Values output in the blue channel that are above .5 indicate the values are increasing bottom-to-top.\t\nHowever it's more clear if you switch the Pixel Format parameter to 32-bit float RGBA so you get a proper representation of negative numbers. Also set the Zero  parameter to 0, and view the  view as Normalized Split to see a good representation of negative numbers.\nslopeTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  red -  - Select which method is used to calculate the slope of the Red channel.

Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.",

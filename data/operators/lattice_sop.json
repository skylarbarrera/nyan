This is the order generated by the Box  when Use Divisions is turned on. The number of divisions must match that of the goemetry or an error is returned.\n\n points - Deform using an arbitrary point clouds.Both the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry must have the same point clouds. Note that any points not within the specified radius of a point in the Rest Geometry will not be deformed. The amount of deformation applied to a point is based upon the weighted average of the deltas of the Rest Geometry to the Deformed . The weighting function is taken from the specified metaball kernal, so behavior is similar to applying a magnet metaball to every point in the Rest .",

There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame.

The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text.

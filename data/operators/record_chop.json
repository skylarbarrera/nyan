The optional second (Active) input is used to enable and disable the recording.\t\t\nDuring recording, the Record  uses only the values of the first input at the current frame. The Type determines how the input values are converted.\t\t\t\nTip: The Trail CHOP also records the last window of samples, and more powerfully, the gestureCapture component in the  gives more control over multi-captures and smoothing channel data.\t\t\t\nIf Record is set to Auto Range, and the Active input goes on, and TouchDesigner is playing, then any existing storage array is cleared, and the channels are recorded in a new storage array until Active goes off.

When the active input is in the off state the input is maintained at its current values. add - Adds (offsets) to an existing set of channels previously recorded in the Record . The channels are left unmodified while the Active input is in the off state. auto - Creates an interval based on Active on/off.\n\t\t\n  sample -  - Determines whether record should sample the time slice or the current frame. You would generally want to use Current , for audio, as all frames will be evaluated.\t\nIf the interval is set to be the Current , it will always cook (only look at) the current frame (things downstream still cook regardless of this setting however). Thus, it should generally not be used for audio, but rather fro things like device input, because it interpolates the values between the captured frames.\n\n\n scur - sslice -\n\t\t\n  interp -  - Determines how to compute missed input samples using interpolation. Using Hold Previous Value does just that; Linear and Cubic interpolation will create a mathematical blend of values in a linear (straight line between values in time), or cubic (smooth round-off curve between beginning and ending values).\n\n hold - linear - cubic -\n\t\t\n  output -  - Determines the frame range that gets output from the .\n\n full - The frame range grows from the moment and frame you start recording. Samples get recorded over when TouchDesigner goes over a frame a second time. Press Reset Channels to start again. curframe - Outputs the current frame only. frame1 - Outputs the current frame but shifts it to frame 1. If the channels are not changing value, it reduces the amount of cooking that takes place. slice - Outputs the current Time Slice of samples only. segment - Outputs a sliding window of samples defined by the Record Segment start/end length.\n\t\t\n  segment -  - The data gets recorded in a fixed-range interval and the most recent data gets recorded at the end of the interval and the remaining samples get shifted toward the start of the interval. This is useful for making snakes.\n\nsegment1 -segment2 -\n\t\t\n  segmentunit - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reset - The current output is cleared and all subsequent channels will commence single sample lengths.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetcondition -  - Enabled when a  is connected to the Record 's 3rd input (ie. Input 2). Determines what condition is required to trigger a reset using this input.\n\n offtoon - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from Off to On ie. 0 to 1. on - Resets the recording when the input channel is On ie. 1. ontooff - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from On to Off ie. 1 to 0. off - Resets the recording when the input channel is Off ie. 0.\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Record  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Record_CHOP&oldid=24082\"\n\t\tCategory: CHOPs",

This is useful for making snakes.\n\nsegment1 -segment2 -\n\t\t\n  segmentunit - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reset - The current output is cleared and all subsequent channels will commence single sample lengths.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetcondition -  - Enabled when a  is connected to the Record 's 3rd input (ie. Input 2). Determines what condition is required to trigger a reset using this input.\n\n offtoon - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from Off to On ie. 0 to 1. on - Resets the recording when the input channel is On ie. 1. ontooff - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from On to Off ie. 1 to 0. off - Resets the recording when the input channel is Off ie. 0.\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Record  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Record_CHOP&oldid=24082\"",

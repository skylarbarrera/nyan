      "description": "From Derivative\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJump to navigation\n\t\tJump to search\n\t\t\nThe Engine  will run a  file (component) in a separate process. It uses TouchEngine to manage these processes and pass data between the loaded component and the main project.\nInputs and Outputs\nThe chosen component's top-level Inputs and Outputs are exposed as inputs and outputs on the Engine . Only TOP, CHOP and DAT inputs and outputs are supported.\nCustom Parameters\nAny custom parameters on the top-level component are added to the Engine 's parameters. Custom parameters which refer to other nodes in the network, such as TOP, CHOP and DAT parameters, are not supported - you should use inputs to connect those nodes instead.\nNote that parameters work in one direction only - you cannot set a parameter from within the loaded .\nExternal File Paths\nBy default, relative paths on OPs or in scripts inside the loaded component are relative to the  file's location. This can be changed with the 'Asset Paths' parameter. Relative paths as file or folder custom parameters of the component - those that show up on the Engine  - are always relative to the main project.\nMonitoring Engine Status\nIt is useful to monitor the state and performance of the Engine . By default, an Info DAT is docked to the Engine  and contains file path and process ID. A docked Info CHOP contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.\nControlling Engine State\nThe Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your  component automatically. But you can have more control over the time/memory management of multiple components using the Unload, Reload pulse parameters for the currently-loaded  file. On the Advanced page, the Launch and Quit Engine Process parameters give you terminate/restart control of the entire Engine process.\n Lifetime\nUnder TouchEngine, components are loaded into an already-running instance. For this reason, an Execute DAT's onStart() and onExit() method will never be executed under TouchEngine. The onCreate() method will be executed when the component is loaded, and is a good place to do any setup you would normally do in onStart().\nTime in TouchEngine\nWhen the Engine  starts the component (after it has loaded, if 'Start when Initialized' is On), the component time in TouchEngine is 0. It will then increase either in sync with the Engine  or according to TouchEngine's internal clock, depending on the setting of the 'Clock' parameter on the Tune parameter page.\nAn input buffer and output buffer are used to allow for differences in cook rate between the Engine  and TouchEngine. Often you may want to adjust the parameters on the Tune page to suit your particular setup. The Engine  will cook frames to fill its input buffer, if required, prior to starting to cook the component in TouchEngine - then will cook frames in TouchEngine to fill its output buffer prior to emitting output from the Engine . The Auto setting will attempt to keep small buffers sufficient to avoid dropped frames, but you may wish to set a fixed buffer size to suit your setup, particularly if working with audio.\nTouchEngine Versions\nTouchEngine is installed as part of TouchDesigner, and the currently running version will be used to load the given . If you wish to use a different version of TouchEngine you can either set the environment variable TOUCHENGINE_APP_PATH to the path to a TouchDesigner installation (an installation directory on Windows, or a TouchDesigner app on macOS) or install TouchDesigner into a folder named TouchEngine alongside the  (on macOS rename an application from TouchDesigner to TouchEngine) or create a link named TouchEngine alongside the  which points to an installation directory or TouchDesigner app.\nengineCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  file - Specify the  file to load with TouchEngine.\n\n\n\n  unload - Unload the currently loaded component.\n\n\n\n  reload - Reload the currently loaded component.\n\n\n\n  reloadoncrash - If the TouchEngine instance quits for any reason, restart it.\n\n\n\n  assetpaths -  - Specify how relative paths inside the component are resolved.\n\n project - Relative paths inside the component are relative to the project file running TouchEngine. comp - Relative paths inside the component are relative to the component ( file).\n\n  callbacks - The Callbacks  will execute for events related to the TouchEngine instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n  clock -  - Specify the temporal connection to the TouchEngine instance.\n\n synced - Time is strictly synchronized between the Engine  and the TouchEngine instance. independent - The TouchEngine instance runs according to its own internal clock.\n\n  matchrate - When on, the component will be cooked in TouchEngine at the same rate as the Engine .\n\n\n\n  fps - The framerate for cooking the component in TouchEngine.\n\n\n\n  wait - When enabled, if a frame takes a long time to cook in TouchEngine the Engine  will wait during cooking rather than dropping the late frame.\nThis behaviour is affected by the size of the output buffer: eg if Out Buffer Frames is 4, the Engine  will wait for the 4th most recent frame to complete.\n\n\n\n  timeout - When waiting for a frame, TouchEngine will give up waiting after this many milliseconds.\n\n\n\n  inauto - Automatically manage the number of input frames queued.\n\n\n\n  inframes - The number of input frames to queue before passing them to the TouchEngine instance.\nTo accommodate potential fluctuations in time-slice in the TouchEngine instance,  inputs must send a number of frames ahead of time.\n\n\n\n  outauto - Automatically manage the number of output frames queued.\n\n\n\n  outframes - The number of output frames to queue after receiving them from the TouchEngine instance.\nTo accommodate potential fluctuations in time-slice in the Engine ,  outputs must send a number of frames ahead of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n  preroll - At initialization, run for this long before entering the ready state.\n\n\n\n  prerollunits -  - The units in which the Pre-Roll is measured.\n\n frames - The Pre-Roll is measured in frames. seconds - The Pre-Roll is measured in seconds.\n\n  readywhen -  - Specify when the Engine  will go into the ready state.\n\n loaded - The Engine  will go into the ready state when TouchEngine has loaded the component. buffered - The Engine  will go into the ready state when TouchEngine has loaded the component and sufficient frames have been cooked to fill the input and output buffers. running - The Engine  will go into the ready state when TouchEngine has loaded the component, sufficient frames have been cooked to fill the input and output buffers and the component is running.\n\n  startoninit - When enabled, playback will start as soon as the component has initialized and is in the ready state.\n\n\n\n  initialize - Reload the  file, restarting the TouchEngine instance.\n\n\n\n  start - Starts playback of the component in the TouchEngine instance.\n\n\n\n  play - Turn cooking in the TouchEngine instance on or off.\n\n\n\n  gotodone - Puts the Engine  in the done state.\n\n\n\n  ondone -  - Determines the actions taken, if any, when the Engine  enters the done state.\n\n donothing - Apart from the state change, nothing happens and TouchEngine continues to run the component. pause - Playback of the loaded component is paused. unload - The loaded component is unloaded. reinit - The loaded component is unloaded and then initialization takes place. restart - The component remains loaded and playback begins again. quit - TouchEngine is completely shut down.\n\n\n\n  oncompcreate -  - Specify what happens when the Engine  is created, for example when the project is loaded.\n\n nothing - Nothing happens when the Engine  is created. launch - TouchEngine is started when the Engine  is created.

Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component.

Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Engine  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - The number of frames in the input buffer. This is affected by parameters on the Tune parameter page.\n - The number of frames in the output buffer. This is affected by parameters on the Tune parameter page.\n - The value of cook_abs_frame when the current output was cooked. This is affected by the number of frames in the output buffer.\n - 1 when the Engine  waited for output to cook. This will only be 1 when Wait for Render is On and is affected by the time taken to complete a frame in TouchEngine and the number of input and output buffers. See the Tune parameter page for more details.\n - 1 while the Engine  is in the initializing state.\n - 1 if an error occurred during initialization. This would normally indicate an error loading the component in TouchEngine.\n - 1 after initialization completes and before starting.\n - 1 after starting and until the Engine  enters the done state or is re-initialized.\n - 1 when the Engine  is in the done state.\n - In the Engine , this matches playing_seconds.\n - Seconds elapsed since starting, accounting for play state.\n - Seconds elapsed since starting.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is starting, prior to loading any component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has started and is running.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is not running.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has encountered an error unrelated to the component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is loading a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has successfully loaded a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is unloading a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has no loaded component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine encountered an error loading or running a component.\n - The number of times the component has been reloaded due to an error when Reload on Crash is On.\n - The value for absolute time in frames in TouchEngine.\n - The value for absolute time in seconds in TouchEngine.\n - The number of frames rendered in the last second in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of time each frame takes to cook in msec in TouchEngine.\n - Is equal to 1 when a frame is cooked and equal to 0 when a frame is skipped in TouchEngine.\n - The number of frames dropped between the last frame and the current frame in TouchEngine.\n - How many times the movie read ahead failed to maintain the number of specified Read Ahead frames in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of  memory used in TouchEngine (in megabytes).\n - Total amount of  memory available on the system (in megabytes).\n - How many OPs are actively cooking in TouchEngine.\n - Number of calls to cook a component that has its Cooking  turned off in TouchEngine.\n - Total number of OPs in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of CPU memory used in TouchEngine (in megabytes).\n - Monitors which frames actually cooked in TouchEngine.\n - Monitors the state of the realtime flag, determining if TouchEngine is running in realtime mode or not.\n - The global target cook rate (frames per second) of TouchEngine. This is the frames per second of the root component, root.time.rate, typically 60, though due to frames taking too long to cook, the actual frames per second may be lower.\n - The number of frames that TouchEngine stepped forward for the current cook. It's the length of the  in frames. It will be equal to 1 when the system is taking 1000/root.time.rate msec or less to complete one frame (16.666 msec for a rate of 60).\n - The length of the current  in milliseconds.\n - The number of active python expressions found in TouchEngine.\n - The number of python expressions that have been optimized in TouchEngine.\n - The number of python expressions that have been cached in TouchEngine.\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-replace2023.112802022.241402021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nIndicator of certain states of an operator (bypass, display, lock, viewer active).\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Engine_COMP&oldid=30973\"\n\t\tCategories: OP Help Common PagesCOMPs",

See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes.

      "description": "The Engine  will run a  file (component) in a separate process. It uses TouchEngine to manage these processes and pass data between the loaded component and the main project.\nInputs and Outputs\nThe chosen component's top-level Inputs and Outputs are exposed as inputs and outputs on the Engine . Only TOP, CHOP and DAT inputs and outputs are supported.\nCustom Parameters\nAny custom parameters on the top-level component are added to the Engine 's parameters. Custom parameters which refer to other nodes in the network, such as TOP, CHOP and DAT parameters, are not supported - you should use inputs to connect those nodes instead.\nNote that parameters work in one direction only - you cannot set a parameter from within the loaded .\nExternal File Paths\nBy default, relative paths on OPs or in scripts inside the loaded component are relative to the  file's location. This can be changed with the 'Asset Paths' parameter. Relative paths as file or folder custom parameters of the component - those that show up on the Engine  - are always relative to the main project.\nMonitoring Engine Status\nIt is useful to monitor the state and performance of the Engine . By default, an Info DAT is docked to the Engine  and contains file path and process ID. A docked Info CHOP contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.\nControlling Engine State\nThe Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your  component automatically. But you can have more control over the time/memory management of multiple components using the Unload, Reload pulse parameters for the currently-loaded  file. On the Advanced page, the Launch and Quit Engine Process parameters give you terminate/restart control of the entire Engine process.\n Lifetime\nUnder TouchEngine, components are loaded into an already-running instance. For this reason, an Execute DAT's onStart() and onExit() method will never be executed under TouchEngine. The onCreate() method will be executed when the component is loaded, and is a good place to do any setup you would normally do in onStart().\nTime in TouchEngine\nWhen the Engine  starts the component (after it has loaded, if 'Start when Initialized' is On), the component time in TouchEngine is 0. It will then increase either in sync with the Engine  or according to TouchEngine's internal clock, depending on the setting of the 'Clock' parameter on the Tune parameter page.\nAn input buffer and output buffer are used to allow for differences in cook rate between the Engine  and TouchEngine. Often you may want to adjust the parameters on the Tune page to suit your particular setup. The Engine  will cook frames to fill its input buffer, if required, prior to starting to cook the component in TouchEngine - then will cook frames in TouchEngine to fill its output buffer prior to emitting output from the Engine . The Auto setting will attempt to keep small buffers sufficient to avoid dropped frames, but you may wish to set a fixed buffer size to suit your setup, particularly if working with audio.\nTouchEngine Versions\nTouchEngine is installed as part of TouchDesigner, and the currently running version will be used to load the given .

This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Engine  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - The number of frames in the input buffer. This is affected by parameters on the Tune parameter page.\n - The number of frames in the output buffer. This is affected by parameters on the Tune parameter page.\n - The value of cook_abs_frame when the current output was cooked. This is affected by the number of frames in the output buffer.\n - 1 when the Engine  waited for output to cook. This will only be 1 when Wait for Render is On and is affected by the time taken to complete a frame in TouchEngine and the number of input and output buffers. See the Tune parameter page for more details.\n - 1 while the Engine  is in the initializing state.\n - 1 if an error occurred during initialization. This would normally indicate an error loading the component in TouchEngine.\n - 1 after initialization completes and before starting.\n - 1 after starting and until the Engine  enters the done state or is re-initialized.\n - 1 when the Engine  is in the done state.\n - In the Engine , this matches playing_seconds.\n - Seconds elapsed since starting, accounting for play state.\n - Seconds elapsed since starting.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is starting, prior to loading any component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has started and is running.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is not running.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has encountered an error unrelated to the component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is loading a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has successfully loaded a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine is unloading a component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine has no loaded component.\n - 1 when TouchEngine encountered an error loading or running a component.\n - The number of times the component has been reloaded due to an error when Reload on Crash is On.\n - The value for absolute time in frames in TouchEngine.\n - The value for absolute time in seconds in TouchEngine.\n - The number of frames rendered in the last second in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of time each frame takes to cook in msec in TouchEngine.\n - Is equal to 1 when a frame is cooked and equal to 0 when a frame is skipped in TouchEngine.\n - The number of frames dropped between the last frame and the current frame in TouchEngine.\n - How many times the movie read ahead failed to maintain the number of specified Read Ahead frames in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of  memory used in TouchEngine (in megabytes).\n - Total amount of  memory available on the system (in megabytes).\n - How many OPs are actively cooking in TouchEngine.\n - Number of calls to cook a component that has its Cooking  turned off in TouchEngine.\n - Total number of OPs in TouchEngine.\n - Amount of CPU memory used in TouchEngine (in megabytes).\n - Monitors which frames actually cooked in TouchEngine.\n - Monitors the state of the realtime flag, determining if TouchEngine is running in realtime mode or not.\n - The global target cook rate (frames per second) of TouchEngine. This is the frames per second of the root component, root.time.rate, typically 60, though due to frames taking too long to cook, the actual frames per second may be lower.\n - The number of frames that TouchEngine stepped forward for the current cook. It's the length of the  in frames. It will be equal to 1 when the system is taking 1000/root.time.rate msec or less to complete one frame (16.666 msec for a rate of 60).\n - The length of the current  in milliseconds.\n - The number of active python expressions found in TouchEngine.\n - The number of python expressions that have been optimized in TouchEngine.\n - The number of python expressions that have been cached in TouchEngine.\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-replace2023.112802022.241402021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nIndicator of certain states of an operator (bypass, display, lock, viewer active).\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Engine_COMP&oldid=30973\"",

When a portion of the surface is trimmed, it is not actually removed from the surface; instead, that part is made invisible. This means that you can still modify the surface (modify the position of its points, for instance) that is not displayed in order to affect the part that is displayed.\t\nThe surface can be trimmed by specifying open or closed profiles as inside or outside regions. The profiles need not be contained within the domain (UV space) of the surface; they can also be nested.\t\t\nOpen profiles are treated as follows: if both ends of the profile are inside the surface, the ends are connected to one another; if the profile's ends are outside the domain of the surface they are projected onto, that part of the surface appears to be cut away.\t\t\nYou will usually need a Trim , Bridge SOP, or Profile SOP after a Project SOP.\t\t\n\nUse a Trim  to cut a hole in the projected surface.\nUse a Bridge SOP to skin the profile curve to another profile curve.\nUse a Profile SOP to extract the curve on surface or remap it's position.\nThe selection method employed for clarifying overlapping trim loops is the winding rule, which executes overlapping commands instead of having them cancel each other out.\t\t\nTip: Since only surfaces containing profile curves can be trimmed, you will always need a Project or Carve SOP in the chain above the Trim .\ntrimSOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  group - This field allows you to specify the group that you would like to trim. You can select the group from the pop-up menu, or specify a points and primitives range.\t\nYou can specify profile curves within the group by providing a profile pattern (e.g. *.3 specifies the fourth profile in all spline surfaces).\n\n\n\t\t\n  optype -  - The types of trimming operations available.\n\n keepout - Trims the interior of the curve, or makes a hole in the display of the surface. Keeping what's outside the profile curve generates an outer trim loop in order to define the limits of the surface to be displayed-the surface that's outside of the profile curve. keepin - Keeps the interior of the curve and removes the display of everything else. keepnatural - Trim based on the natural orientation of the profiles, be they open or not. Counter-clockwise profiles keep their interior, generating a result similar to . Clockwise profiles discard their interior, similar to , and may require an explicit outer trim-loop if none is present. untrim - Turns the trim curve into a plain profile. chgalt -\n\t\t\n  individual - When this option is off, the trim loops in the group (or all the loops on the surfaces if no group has been specified) will be considered together to form a region. It will report the first region that is found. That is, if more than one closed loop could be formed by joining the lines, there is no guarantee that the region is trimmed. Also, if there is a closed loop in the group of loops, then just that loop is used.\t\nIf the loops on the surface don't form a closed loop, then the  will attempt to form a region by using the boundary of the region. If all the loops make a total of two intersections with the boundary, then it will attempt to form the loop by forming it around the boundary.\t\t\nFor example: Use the Carve SOP to extract four profiles: two in U, and two in V.  that into a Trim  and turn this option off. The four profiles will define a region to be trimmed. Notice that the profile end-points do not coincide, and the profiles are not parametrically continuous, nor are they created in the proper order. Despite all this, the Trim  is able to figure out the hole.\n\n\n\t\t\n  bigloop - This option allows you to specify that an outer trim loop be built. It is useful where you have more than one profile curve on the surface and are performing several successive trim operations involving both the  and  options (see example, below).\t\nTip: An outer trim loop must be generated the first time you punch a hole in the surface, but not if you just keep the contents of that hole and throw away the rest. By default, the outer loop (which goes all around the domain boundary) is built for you automatically. Sometimes, however, you first do a Keep Inside, then a Keep Outside with an area that's not inside the preserved regions, so you may want the outer curve at that point. That is when this parameter is useful.\n\n\n\t\t\n  trimtol - How close two trim curves must be to each other or to the edge of the patch in order to be considered an intersection.\n\n\n\t\t\n  altitude - You can specify the altitude of the trim. The $ALTITUDE variable is the surface's current altitude. This marks the transition for the surface from trimmed in to trimmed out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following results were obtained by using a Project SOP to project two NURBS circles onto a NURBS grid.

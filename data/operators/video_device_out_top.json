Set the Library parameter above prior to selecting your device.\n\n V1 -\n\n  signalformat - The signal format to output at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.\n\n\n\n  outputpixelformat -  - Set the pixel format of the output when possible (depends what type of device is used).\tData may be converted to YUV colorspace depending on what the device and settings require.\n\n fixed8 - 8-bit color data, no alpha channel. fixed8key8 - 8-bit color data and 8-bit alpha. This usually means SDI cables where one cable will be the color data and one cable will be the alpha data. fixed10 - 10-bit color data, no alpha. fixed12 -\n\n  outputcolorspace -  - Set the color space of the data sent out, for supported devices.\n\n yuv422 - YUV 4:2:2. This is the most common color space to send data over SDI wires. It requires lower bandwidth than RGB 4:4:4, but results in some information loss. rgb444 - RGB 4:4:4. This is RGB values taken directly from the  without any colorspace conversion (except for possibly pixel format).

You can use the 'odd_field' value in the Info CHOP on the Movie File In TOP or Video Device In TOP to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In , so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.\n\n\n\n  firstfield - Tells the Video Device Out  if the current frame being given as it's input is the First or Second field in the final output image, when outputting an interlaced video. Look at the description for Manual Field Control for more information.\n\n\n\n  timecodeop - Embed timecode into the output.

Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios.

This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on.

Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Video Device Out  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - 1 if the device is connected/active, 0 if not.\n - The play speed of the audio data. 1 if it's playing at normal speed, it'll be slightly faster or slower if it's needing to adjust the queue size to hit the target size.\n - The number of frames drops from the output. These are frames that the output failed to provide new data for. If TD is running lower than the framerate the signal format is running at, this value should be increasing.\n - These are frames that TD produced, but didn't get consumed by the output. This can be caused by the PCIe bandwidth (or the device) running slower than what is required for the data throughput/framerate.\n - These are frames that were delivered to the card in time, but ended up getting shown later than expected. Usually only tracked on Blackmagic devices.\n - The number of video frames queued in software for output.\n - The number of video frames queued in the device hardware for output.\n - The length of the audio buffer (in seconds) in software.\n - The length of the audio buffer (in seconds) in the device hardware.\n - 1 if the card is known to be genlocked to an input, 0 if is card is not. -1 if it's not known.\n - The amount of time (in milliseconds) the last copy from the driver memory to the device took. -1 if it's not measured by this device type.\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2023.112802022.241402021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Video_Device_Out_TOP&oldid=30387\"\n\t\tCategory: TOPs",

Set the Library parameter above prior to selecting your device.\n\n V1 -\n\n  signalformat - The signal format to output at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.\n\n\n\n  outputpixelformat -  - Set the pixel format of the output when possible (depends what type of device is used).\tData may be converted to YUV colorspace depending on what the device and settings require.\n\n fixed8 - 8-bit color data, no alpha channel. fixed8key8 - 8-bit color data and 8-bit alpha. This usually means SDI cables where one cable will be the color data and one cable will be the alpha data. fixed10 - 10-bit color data, no alpha. fixed12 -\n\n  outputcolorspace -  - Set the color space of the data sent out, for supported devices.\n\n yuv422 - YUV 4:2:2. This is the most common color space to send data over SDI wires. It requires lower bandwidth than RGB 4:4:4, but results in some information loss. rgb444 - RGB 4:4:4. This is RGB values taken directly from the  without any colorspace conversion (except for possibly pixel format). This requires more bandwidth but doesn't suffer from the information loss that YUV 4:2:2 has.\n\n  chop - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a Time Sliced  here.\n\n\n\n  referencesource -  - On AJA devices what input to use as a reference source input.\n\n default - external - sdi1 - sdi2 - sdi3 - sdi4 - sdi5 - sdi6 - sdi7 - sdi8 -\n\n  audiochop - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a Time Sliced  here.\n\n\n\n  bufferlength - The length in seconds to buffer the audio data, to avoid crackles and pops.\n\n\n\n  audiobitdepth -  - Describes the number of bits of information used for each sample.\n\n 16bit - 32bit -\n\n  manualfield - When outputting interlaced video if you are using a source video that is also interlaced, it's likely you'll want to make sure you are keeping the odd/even fields in sync, otherwise the video will look stuttery. You can use the 'odd_field' value in the Info CHOP on the Movie File In TOP or Video Device In TOP to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In , so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.\n\n\n\n  firstfield - Tells the Video Device Out  if the current frame being given as it's input is the First or Second field in the final output image, when outputting an interlaced video. Look at the description for Manual Field Control for more information.\n\n\n\n  timecodeop - Embed timecode into the output. A reference to either a  with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a  with a timecode string in its first cell, or a Timecode Class object.\n\n\n\n  transfermode -  - Controls how the image data is transfered between the  and the output card.\n\n automatic - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. It will choose 'Pinned' when possible, since that is the best performance. default - Transfer will be done in 3 stages.  to CPU memory. CPU memory to driver memory. Driver memory to output card. pinned - Transfer will be done in 2 stages.  to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.\n\n  syncoutputs - Only currently supported on the Deltacast FLEX line of cards. This will cause multiple FLEX cards to output their content in sync with each other.\n\n\n\n  syncgroupindex - For different groups of cards, they can be ganged together into different sync groups by specifying the same index for multiple cards in the same group.\n\n\n\n  resetstats - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation.

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the Movie File In TOP can set the image resolution. See Aspect Ratio for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Video_Device_Out_TOP&oldid=30387\"",

You can use the 'odd_field' value in the Info CHOP on the Movie File In TOP or Video Device In TOP to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out  that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In , so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.",

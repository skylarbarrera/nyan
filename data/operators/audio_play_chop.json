The audio channels can then be routed to any speaker location that DirectSound uses. See Outputs section below.\t\t\nNOTE: With the Audio Play , audio samples do not enter or pass through TouchDesigner, so you will not see them in CHOPs, and you cannot process them in CHOPs. The Audio Play  starts an external process that opens the file and sends it directly to the the audio outputs of your computer. If you want to process the audio within TouchDesigner or output them into a Movie File Out TOP or Audio Device Out CHOP, use the Audio File In CHOP.\t\t\t\nThe Audio Play  contains a channel called state.  This channel is 1 whenever any file is being played, 0 otherwise.\t\t\t\nThe first input (Input 0:Triggers) is used to trigger the audio file to play. The second input (Input 1: Volume) can be used to control volume, if no input is connected the  parameter will be used. The third input (Input 2: Pan) is for panning, no input assumes it is centered. When using the  parameter, the inputs can contain mulitiple channels to manipulate each file individually. Multiple Audio Play CHOPs can output to different devices simutaneously.\t\t\t\nIt can also be triggered by the  parameter below, but in this case if multiple files are specified via the  List, then all files will be played at the same time when triggered.\t\t\t\nSound files can also be triggered through the play() method audioplayCHOP_Class.

      "description": "The Audio Play  plays back a sound file through any attached audio output device using DirectSound. It supports .aif, .mp3, .mid, .wav and .m4a files up to 48.000 kHz, which can have mono, stereo or even up to 5.1 channels in them. The audio channels can then be routed to any speaker location that DirectSound uses. See Outputs section below.\t\t\nNOTE: With the Audio Play , audio samples do not enter or pass through TouchDesigner, so you will not see them in CHOPs, and you cannot process them in CHOPs. The Audio Play  starts an external process that opens the file and sends it directly to the the audio outputs of your computer. If you want to process the audio within TouchDesigner or output them into a Movie File Out TOP or Audio Device Out CHOP, use the Audio File In CHOP.\t\t\t\nThe Audio Play  contains a channel called state.  This channel is 1 whenever any file is being played, 0 otherwise.\t\t\t\nThe first input (Input 0:Triggers) is used to trigger the audio file to play. The second input (Input 1: Volume) can be used to control volume, if no input is connected the  parameter will be used. The third input (Input 2: Pan) is for panning, no input assumes it is centered. When using the  parameter, the inputs can contain mulitiple channels to manipulate each file individually. Multiple Audio Play CHOPs can output to different devices simutaneously.\t\t\t\nIt can also be triggered by the  parameter below, but in this case if multiple files are specified via the  List, then all files will be played at the same time when triggered.\t\t\t\nSound files can also be triggered through the play() method audioplayCHOP_Class. Some advanced options are only available through the audioplayCHOP_Class.\t\t\t\nThe file can be read in from disk or from the web. Use http:// when specifying a URL.\naudioplayCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  device - A menu of available audio devices to output to.

When using the , the first input (Input 0: Triggers) on the  can contain mulitiple channels to fire the files in the list individually. Using the audioplay command the index can be specified directly.\n\n\n\t\t\n  volume - 0 = mute, 1 = full volume. Using the second input (Input 1: Volume) or the python .play(volume=val) method, will override the value of this parameter.\n\n\n\t\t\n  mode -  - Determines how the audio is triggered when using the first input to trigger.\n\n on - Plays while input is 1. trigger - Triggers once when input goes to 1. loop - Plays and loops when input goes to 1.\n\t\t\n  trigger - Triggers the audio to play.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cookalways - Forces  to cook every frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n  stereo - Sets output to just 2 channels, front left and front right. \t\nOutputs - The outputs on this page and the following  page are for routing to an audio device's different speaker outputs. Not all devices will support all outputs. For each speaker output, you can route any of the file's channels to play through it. For example, you can easily output the front left channel of the file to the all the front left speaker outputs, or you could output the front left channel to both front and rear speaker outputs. The value of each output parameter determines which channel from the file it plays, see below.\t\t\t\nFile's channel mapping for outputs\n\n-1 - no audio plays through this output\n0 - File's front left channel will play\n1 - File's front right channel will play\n2 - File's rear left channel will play\n3 - File's rear right channel will play\n4 - File's center channel will play\n5 - File's sub or low frequency channel will playThe following speaker outputs are found on this parameter page.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontleft - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontright - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lowfrequency - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backleft - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backright - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontleftcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  frontrightcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  backcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following speaker outputs are found on this parameter page.\n\n  sideleft - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  sideright - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontleft - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topfrontright - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackleft - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackcenter - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  topbackright - Play audio on this output based on mapping table above.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Audio_Play_CHOP&oldid=24454\"",

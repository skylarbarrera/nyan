The TaskBar is ignored when using this option.\n\t\n  ignoretaskbar - The Windows taskBar is ignored when this option is 'On'. When off the taskbar is accounted for so position and sizing will not cover it up.\n\n\n\t\t\n  monitor - Specify the monitor index when  is set to Single Monitor.\n\n\n\t\t\n  justifyh -  - Aligns the window horizontally with the monitor or bounds of all monitors.\n\n left - Align window so that left edge coincides with left edge of specified area. center - Align window so that horizontal center coincides with horizontal center of specified area. right - Align window so that right edge coincides with right edge of specified area. mouse - Align window so it opens horizontally centered on the mouse cursor.\n\t\t\n  justifyv -  - Aligns the window vertically with the monitor or bounds of all monitors.\n\n top - Align window so that top edge coincides with top edge of specified area. center - Align window so that vertical center coincides with vertical center of specified area. bottom - Align window so that bottom edge coincides with bottom edge of specified area. mouse - Align window so it opens vertically centered on the mouse cursor.\n\t\t\n  winoffset -  - Horizontal offset applied to window after justifying.\n\n winoffsetx - Horizontal offset applied to window after justifying. winoffsety - Vertical offset applied to window after justifying.\n\t\t\n  single - This menu has options for shifting the opening window. You can either shift to a single monitor or shift to the monitor the cursor is over when the window opens.\n\n\n\n  dpiscaling -  - Options for managing DPI scaling on high DPI monitors. To inspect a monitor's DPI scaling setting, you can use the Monitors DAT and refer to the dpi_scale column.\n\n native - Uses the full resolution of the monitor's native pixels, regardless of the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. ie Display Scale = 1.0 usedpiscale - Uses the resolution set by the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. For example, a 3840x2160 monitor with display scaling set to 2.0 results in an addressable resolution of 1920x1080. On Windows system this would be a Display Scaling setting of 200%.\n\t\t\n  size -  - Determines how the size of the window is determined.\n\n automatic - Determines the size automatically from the size of the / specified. fill - Fills the location specified in the  parameter above. custom - Use the  and  parameters below to specify a custom size.\n\t\t\n  winw - The width of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.\n\n\n\t\t\n  winh - The height of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.\n\n\n\t\t\n  update - When the window is open you can reposition and resize it.

Enabled means it will update in sync with the monitors refresh which avoids tearing and lost frames. Disabled means it can update at any point during the refresh which can result in tearing or lost frames.  is Half Monitor Rate should be used when doing things such as running a 30fps file on a 60Hz display. This makes each update be shown for exactly 2 refreshes which keeps motion looking smooth.\n\n disabled - Vertical Sync off. enabled - Vertical Sync on. halfmonitorrate - This allows you to run your project at 30FPS on a 60Hz monitor, but ensuring every image is shown for exactly 2 refreshes. Without this option an image may be shown for 1 or 3 refreshes, which makes the content look like it is stuttering. Currently this feature is not functional in the 2022.20000+ series of builds, but we hope to bring back this feature when Vulkan adds support for it.\n\t\t\n  drawwindow - When disabled the window will not update it's contents at all. Useful for processes that arn't doing rendering such as Audio or networking processes, or for when using VR devices.\n\n\n\t\t\n  hwframelock - Provides multi- frame-lock sync using Nvidia Quadro Sync and AMD S400 sync cards. For more information, see Syncing Multiple Computers and Hardware Frame Lock.\n\n\n\t\t\n  openglstereo - No longer supported. Turn 'On' when using openGL stereoscopic output.\n\n\n\t\t\n  winrightop - No longer supported. This parameter is enabled when the OpenGL Stereo parameter above is turned on. Specify the Camera COMP used for the right eye here.\n\n\n\t\n  performance - Opens this   in Perform Mode. Any   can be set as default Perform  (opens using F1 shortcut) using the Window Placement Dialog. This button allows you to open this   in  without changing what is currently selected as the 'default' Perform .\n\n\n\t\t\n  winopen - Opens this   as its own floating window, not as the Perform . Useful for things such as dialog boxes, popups, or testing, but should not be used for putting final rendered content to outputs. Use a single large Perform  for that instead of separate windows.\n\n\n\t\t\n  winclose - Closes the window, if it's open.\n\n\n\t\t\n  setperform - Permanently changes the Perform  setting in the  Placement dialog to this window.\n\n\n\t\t\n  opendialog - A shortcut to open the  Placement dialog.\n\n\n\t\t\n  includedialog - When 'On' this   will be displayed in the  Placement .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the   can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - - - - - - -\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nA Window in TouchDesigner is a window in Microsoft Windows or macOS that contains either (1) the TouchDesigner editing interface that exists in Designer Mode, or (2) a user-created Panel inside a Window Component. The user-created windows can span Multiple Monitors borderless, or be floating windows with borders, or popups.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nAny floating window that is not a Pane or Viewer.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe term \"Frame\" is a measurement of time used (1) in the Timeline, (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into TOPs and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second (FPS).\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nPerform Mode is an optimized mode for live performance that only renders one specified Window COMP which is one window that contains your video outputs and your (optional) control interface. In Perform Mode the network editing window is not open - you edit your networks in Designer Mode.  Alternate with F1 and Esc.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Window_COMP&oldid=32450\"\n\t\tCategory: COMPs",

      "description": "The   allows you to create and maintain a separate floating or fixed window displaying the contents of any Panel or any Node Viewer. \nMost frequently you are setting up the   /perform in the default TouchDesigner project. /perform is the default window for Perform Mode. In the Parameter dialog of the  component you adjust its settings such as resolution, centering, and which monitor(s) the window will get displayed on.\nYou then press F1 to go into Perform Mode and operate/display the panel standalone.\nPress Esc over a window to close it and go back to Designer Mode.\nYou can create more  Components, point them to panels or other Operators like TOPs, adjust their parameters and then pulse the parameter Open as Separate  to see its effect.\nUse the -> Window Placement Dialog which controls which window COMPs get displayed on startup. All  COMPS in your project are listed there and you can test them individually.\nA window can be fit to a single monitor, or span several monitors.\nAttach an Info CHOP to the  component - it will show you the window's current location and size, and whether the window is actually open.\nSee also Window, Multiple Monitors.\nwindowCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  winop - Specifies the operator the window will display.\n\n\n\t\t\n  title - Specify the window's title.\n\n\n\n  justifyoffsetto -  - All the positioning parameters below are done relative to the location you specify here.

You can either shift to a single monitor or shift to the monitor the cursor is over when the window opens.\n\n\n\n  dpiscaling -  - Options for managing DPI scaling on high DPI monitors. To inspect a monitor's DPI scaling setting, you can use the Monitors DAT and refer to the dpi_scale column.\n\n native - Uses the full resolution of the monitor's native pixels, regardless of the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. ie Display Scale = 1.0 usedpiscale - Uses the resolution set by the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. For example, a 3840x2160 monitor with display scaling set to 2.0 results in an addressable resolution of 1920x1080. On Windows system this would be a Display Scaling setting of 200%.\n\t\t\n  size -  - Determines how the size of the window is determined.\n\n automatic - Determines the size automatically from the size of the / specified. fill - Fills the location specified in the  parameter above. custom - Use the  and  parameters below to specify a custom size.\n\t\t\n  winw - The width of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.\n\n\n\t\t\n  winh - The height of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.\n\n\n\t\t\n  update - When the window is open you can reposition and resize it.

Enabled means it will update in sync with the monitors refresh which avoids tearing and lost frames. Disabled means it can update at any point during the refresh which can result in tearing or lost frames.  is Half Monitor Rate should be used when doing things such as running a 30fps file on a 60Hz display. This makes each update be shown for exactly 2 refreshes which keeps motion looking smooth.\n\n disabled - Vertical Sync off. enabled - Vertical Sync on. halfmonitorrate - This allows you to run your project at 30FPS on a 60Hz monitor, but ensuring every image is shown for exactly 2 refreshes. Without this option an image may be shown for 1 or 3 refreshes, which makes the content look like it is stuttering. Currently this feature is not functional in the 2022.20000+ series of builds, but we hope to bring back this feature when Vulkan adds support for it.\n\t\t\n  drawwindow - When disabled the window will not update it's contents at all. Useful for processes that arn't doing rendering such as Audio or networking processes, or for when using VR devices.\n\n\n\t\t\n  hwframelock - Provides multi- frame-lock sync using Nvidia Quadro Sync and AMD S400 sync cards.

Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Window_COMP&oldid=32450\"",

It loads animation channel data that is formatted using Clip CHOPs. It reads clip  paths from a specified  list which can be dynamically scripted. The Clip Blender plays clips from the list ; each time it reads a clip, it pop's the item off the list, and when the next clip plays through it will continue playing and popping clips off the list until it is empty. Once the list is empty the last animation in the sequence is looped. \nAnimation clips will typically come from an FBX or USD asset but can also be read using the Houdini bclip format or raw chan format. Animation clips found in FBX assets must be extracted from the asset hierarchy and then loaded speerately into a Clip CHOP. All Clip CHOP's loaded into the same clipblender must have the same number of channels, all channel names must match and the all clips must be the same sample rate.

All Clip CHOP's loaded into the same clipblender must have the same number of channels, all channel names must match and the all clips must be the same sample rate.  If any of these 3 important requirements are not met, there will likely be animation glitches.\nUse the Info CHOP and Info DAT to extract information about its current state. See also the Clip CHOP and Clip DAT.\nclipblenderCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  default - Operator path to a valid Clip CHOP.\n\n\n\t\t\n  datlist - Operator path to a valid Table DAT.\n\n\n\t\t\n  target -  - This parameter works in conjunction with the root transform channels as defined on the Channels page of the clpblender  as well as the Clip CHOP parameter called Position Type.

A \"Queue Enable\" channel may be added to the animation clip to define when this clip is safe and unsafe for blending into other clips. If the animation is not safe for blending, the channel would be set to 1, which means the clipblender should \"Queue\" the next clip in the sequence instead of playing it.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA set of commands located in a Text DAT that are triggered to run under certain conditions. There are two scripting languages in TouchDesigner: Python and the original Tscript. Scripts and single-line commands can also be run in the Textport.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nA CHOP outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers (Samples), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be Exported to Parameters.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Clip_Blender_CHOP&oldid=24456\"",

The cross-section primitives are placed at each point of the backbone perpendicular to it. The Backbone Source can have one or several primitives. If there is more than one, Sweep will sweep the cross section along each one.\t\t\nA backbone is a primitive curve that can be open or closed, but must have at least two points. The cross section input can also have multiple primitives, and can be assigned to the backbone in various ways. The origin of the cross section primitive is placed at a point on the backbone by default, but you can also choose a point number of the cross section to place. In most cases, it is best to build 1the cross section primitives in the XY plane; Sweep will automatically orient them properly along the backbone. The orientation of the cross section is based on the direction of the backbone line segment and the positive Z axis. So vertical movement in the backbone will result in the cross section rotating around backbone axis. For example, if you create the cross section in the XY plane, you can maintain its orientation (+Y Up) by building the backbone in the XZ plane.\nIf the backbone primitive(s) have point colors or texture coordinates, they will be maintained and applied to the cross section primitives.\nsweepSOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  xgrp - You can use only a subset of primitives from the Cross-section inputs by specifying a group here.\n\n\n\t\t\n  pathgrp - You can use only a subset of primitives from the Backbone inputs by specifying a group here.\n\n\n\t\t\n  refgrp - You can use only a subset of primitives from the  inputs by specifying a group here.\n\n\n\t\t\n  cycle -  - Determines the Cycle Type based on these menu options.\n\n all - Places all the primitives from the Cross-section input at each point on the Backbone. each - Similar to the above, except the transformation is applied to individual primitives rather than to the whole. cycle - This cycles through incoming primitives when placing them on a backbone. i.e. Start with 0 at vertex 0, primitive 1 > vertex 1, etc.\n\t\t\n  angle - Attempts to fix buckling twists that may occur when sweeping.\n\n\n\t\t\n  noflip - Attempts to fix buckling twists that may occur when sweeping by fixing flipped normals.\n\n\n\t\t\n  skipcoin - When selected, any points right on top of one another will be ignored.\n\n\n\t\t\n  aimatref -  Points are used in conjunction with the backbone to control the orientation of the elements along the sweep. This is done by drawing a line between the reference point and corresponding backbone point in order to determine an angle vector which determines the orientation of the cross-section profiles. Enable this parameter to allow this behaviour.\t\nNote: In order for this to work, you must supply  Points via the third input, and there must be exactly the same number of  Points as there are points in the Backbone.\n\n\n\t\t\n  usevtx - Use vertex number of the incoming cross-section to place the cross-section on the backbone.\n\n\n\t\t\n  vertex - Specify a specific vertex to connect to the backbone.\n\n\n\t\t\n  scale - Scales the cross sections globally.\n\n\n\t\t\n  twist - Cumulative rotation of the cross sections around the backbone.

Suppose you have Thousands of proceedurally animated curves you wish to skin with the Sweep  - rather than performing a skining operation after the animation, make a second set of unanimated geometry that is preskinned. Then assuming your have a matching number of points you can just swap in the animated points into the skinned geometry. \t\t\t\nThis technique is significantly faster than using the Skin Output option of the Sweep , or a Skin  following the Sweep .\n\n\n\t\t\n  fast - Enables an optimized skinning technique which speeds up output from 2 - 4 times in many cases at the expense of accuracy. In order for it to work correctly, the input topologies must remain consistent between cooks and each cross-section must have the same number of vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Sweep  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of points in this . - Number of primitives in this . - Number of particles in this . - Time spent in another thread updating geometry data on the  from the 's CPU data. As it is part of another thread, this time is not part of the usual frame time. - Time spent in another thread updating meta surface geometry data (such as metaballs or nurbs) on the  from the 's CPU data. As it is part of another thread, this time is not part of the usual frame time.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nSOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA Link. The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any Operator Family.\n\n\nThe grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or Link). A Reference is (1) a Parameter Reference, a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a Node Reference, an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.\n\n\nA Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP Exports, node Paths in parameters, and expressions in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a Wire that connects nodes in the same Operator Family.\n\n\n\nEach SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nA surface type in SOPs that includes polygon, curve (NURBS and Bezier), patch (NURBS and Bezier) and other basic shapes like sphere, tube and metaball. Points and Primitives are part of the Geometry Detail, which is a part of a SOP.\n\n\n\nA sequence of vertices form a Polygon in a SOP. Each vertex is an integer index into the Point List, and each Point holds an XYZ position and attributes like Normals and Texture Coordinates.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sweep_SOP&oldid=31200\"",

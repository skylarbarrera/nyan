You view your scene through it and render from its point of view using a Render TOP. \nSee Geometry Viewer to learn about how you can inspect a scene from a camera.\nSee cameraViewport in the  - it's a powerful interactive camera that can be used in place of the basic Camera .\nA Camera  can be attached or linked to any other 3D  in a 3D hierarchy.\ncameraCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\n  projection -  - A pop-up menu lets you choose from Perspective and Orthographic projection types. A third option Perpective to Ortho Blend enables the Projection Blend parameter below which can be used to blend between perspectives. A 4th option Custom Projection Matrix allows you to specify a custom 4x4 projection matrix using a tdu.Matrix,  or a .\n\n perspective - ortho - persporthoblend - custommatrix -\n\t\t\n  projectionblend - Blends between perspective projection and orthographic projection when the Projection parameter is set to Perspective to Ortho Blend.\n\n\n\t\t\n  orthowidth - Only active if Orthographic is chosen from the Projection pop-up menu. This specifies the width of the orthographic projection.\n\n\n\t\t\n  viewanglemethod -  - This menu determines which method is used to define the camera's angle of view.\n\n horzfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view horizontally. vertfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view vertically. focalaperture - Uses the Focal Length and Aperture parameters below to define the camera's angle of view.\n\t\t\n  fov - The field of view (FOV) angle is the angular extend of the scene imaged by the camera.\nUseful Equations\nField of View and Throw Angle: The FOV would be:\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan( (screenWidth / 2) / (distanceToScreen) ) * 2\nFOV = arctan( 0.5 * (screenWidth / distanceToScreen) ) * 2Throw is:\t\t\t\n\nThrow = distanceToScreen / screenWidth\n1/Throw = screenWidth / distanceToScreenIn terms of throw, it's\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan(0.5 * (1/Throw)) * 2\nFOV = arctan(0.5 / Throw) * 2FOV calculations in x and y\nThe above equations can be used to determine FOV_x and FOV_y (ie. horizontally and vertically) using Comera  parameters focal and aperture. In TouchDesigner's Camera , screenWidth = aperture parameter and distanceToScreen = focal parameter (assuming infinity focus), from this \n\nFOV_x = arctan( (aperture / 2) / focal) * 2Furthermore, as mentioned above aperture parameter = aperture_x and if given the resolution in x and y of the rendered view (ie. aspect ratio)\n\naperture_y = resy/resx * aperture_xFrom this\n\nFOV_y = arctan( (aperture_y / 2) / focal ) * 2\n\n\t\t\n  focal - The parameter sets the focal length of the lens, zooming in and out. Perspective is flattened or exaggerated depending on focal length. See FOV Angle parameter for relation of aperture, focal length and field of view angle. Some interesting distortion effects can be acheived with this parameter.\n\n\n\t\t\n  aperture - This value relates to the area through which light can pass for the camera.\n\n\n\t\n  near - This control allows you to designate the near clipping planes. Geometry closer from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\t\t\n  far - This control allows you to designate the far clipping planes. Geometry further away from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\n  winrollpivot -  - \n\n viewport - camera - legacy -\n\n  win -  - These parameters define the center of the window during the rendering process. The window parameter takes the view and expands it to fit the camera's field of vision. It is important to note that this action is independent of perspective. In other words, it acts as though you are panning the camera without actually moving the camera. The units for this parameter are normalized. That is a  X of -0.5 will move the previous center of the image to the left edge of the render.\n\n winx - winy -\n\t\t\n  winsize - The  Size parameter specifies the dimensions for expanding the view. Similar to  X / Y, this parameter creates a zoom effect by scaling the screen before rendering to the viewport.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n  winroll - This parameter sets the amount, in degrees, the window area rolls. This can be set as a static value or as an aspect that changes over the course of the animation. The roll occurs about the centre of the window.\n\n\n\t\t\n  ipdshift - This is the Interpupillary Distance which applies a translation on the X axis. It is separate from the other translations because when doing things such as a Cube Map rendering, the shift needs to occur after the rotation to the other cube face. If you apply the shift directly in the X translate parameter the cameras will be in the incorrect spot for many of the cube faces.\nTo use the IPD with 2 cameras, the right eye camera should be set with +IPD/2 and the left eye camera to -IPD/2.\n\n\n\t\t\n  projmatrixop - When Custom Projection Matrix is selected, this parameters should be filled in a custom 4x4 projection matrix. For ways to specify a matrix in a parameter, refer to the Matrix Parameters article.  The projection matrix should generate depth values in Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL clip range [-1,1].\n\n\n\n  customproj - Takes a  containing a GLSL shader to specify custom projection functions. You must provide one functions in this shader. As a starting point, here are the definitions for the function that is used when custom ones are not provided. This will only be used when the Render  is rendering a 2D output, not cubemaps or fisheye renders. Note that projection works using Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL's [-1,1]. So the position will be clipped when z is outside the range 0 <= z <= w.\n vec4 UserWorldToProj(vec4 worldSpaceVertPosition, int cameraIndex)\t\t\t\n {\t\t\t\n     vec4 projP = uTDMats[cameraIndex].camProj * worldSpaceVertPosition;\t\t\t\n     return projP;\t\t\t\n }\t\t\t\n\nvec3 TDWorldToProj() will automatically call this at the appropriate point. You can use uniforms/samplers in this shader code by declaring them here and providing them in the GLSL page of the Render TOP.\n\n\n\t\t\n  quadreprojsop - Quad Reprojection is a feature that allows reprojection an arbitrary quad in the scene so that portion of the render where it ends up will be blown up to fill the output of the render. Refer to the Quad Reprojection article for more information about this feature.\n\n\n\n  quadreprojpts -  - Specifies 4 point indices in the  referenced by Quad Reproject  that make up the quad that determines the region to be reprojected. The indices should be listed in bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right order, as viewed from the camera. The  that is referenced should be in the  that is being rendered, so the world transform that will be applied to is can be taken into account.\n\n quadreprojpts1 - quadreprojpts2 - quadreprojpts3 - quadreprojpts4 -\n\n\n\n  bgcolor -  - Sets the background color and alpha of the camera's view.\n\n bgcolorr - bgcolorg - bgcolorb - bgcolora -\n\t\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n  fog -  - This menu determines the type of fog rendered in the viewport: Linear fog uses the following equation:\t\n\t\t\t\nExponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSquared Exponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\n\n\n off - linear - exp - exp2 -\n\t\t\n  fogdensity - A value that specifies density or thickness, used in both exponential fog types. Only non-negative densities are accepted.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fognear - The starting distance of the fog. If geometry is closer to the camera than this distance, fog will not be calculated in the color of the geometry. Used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogfar - The far distance used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogcolor -  - The color of the fog.\n\n fogcolorr - fogcolorg - fogcolorb -\n\t\t\n  fogalpha - Used to control the background opacity of the scene.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogmap - Use a  texture as a color map for the fog.\n\n\n\t\t\n  camlightmask - Allows only specific lights to be used by this camera. This is used in conjunction with the Lights parameter in the Render  to determine what lights are used to illuminate the geometry. When this parameter is left blank, all lights specified in the Render  will be used. Lights specified in this parameter will limit the geometry's lighting with this camera to the light(s)specified assuming the light(s) is also listed in the Render .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Camera  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nHierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA Window in TouchDesigner is a window in Microsoft Windows or macOS that contains either (1) the TouchDesigner editing interface that exists in Designer Mode, or (2) a user-created Panel inside a Window Component.

OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Camera_COMP&oldid=31117\"\n\t\tCategory: COMPs",

You view your scene through it and render from its point of view using a Render TOP. \nSee Geometry Viewer to learn about how you can inspect a scene from a camera.\nSee cameraViewport in the  - it's a powerful interactive camera that can be used in place of the basic Camera .\nA Camera  can be attached or linked to any other 3D  in a 3D hierarchy.\ncameraCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\n  projection -  - A pop-up menu lets you choose from Perspective and Orthographic projection types. A third option Perpective to Ortho Blend enables the Projection Blend parameter below which can be used to blend between perspectives. A 4th option Custom Projection Matrix allows you to specify a custom 4x4 projection matrix using a tdu.Matrix,  or a .\n\n perspective - ortho - persporthoblend - custommatrix -\n\t\t\n  projectionblend - Blends between perspective projection and orthographic projection when the Projection parameter is set to Perspective to Ortho Blend.\n\n\n\t\t\n  orthowidth - Only active if Orthographic is chosen from the Projection pop-up menu. This specifies the width of the orthographic projection.\n\n\n\t\t\n  viewanglemethod -  - This menu determines which method is used to define the camera's angle of view.\n\n horzfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view horizontally. vertfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view vertically. focalaperture - Uses the Focal Length and Aperture parameters below to define the camera's angle of view.\n\t\t\n  fov - The field of view (FOV) angle is the angular extend of the scene imaged by the camera.\nUseful Equations\nField of View and Throw Angle: The FOV would be:\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan( (screenWidth / 2) / (distanceToScreen) ) * 2\nFOV = arctan( 0.5 * (screenWidth / distanceToScreen) ) * 2Throw is:\t\t\t\n\nThrow = distanceToScreen / screenWidth\n1/Throw = screenWidth / distanceToScreenIn terms of throw, it's\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan(0.5 * (1/Throw)) * 2\nFOV = arctan(0.5 / Throw) * 2FOV calculations in x and y\nThe above equations can be used to determine FOV_x and FOV_y (ie. horizontally and vertically) using Comera  parameters focal and aperture. In TouchDesigner's Camera , screenWidth = aperture parameter and distanceToScreen = focal parameter (assuming infinity focus), from this \n\nFOV_x = arctan( (aperture / 2) / focal) * 2Furthermore, as mentioned above aperture parameter = aperture_x and if given the resolution in x and y of the rendered view (ie. aspect ratio)\n\naperture_y = resy/resx * aperture_xFrom this\n\nFOV_y = arctan( (aperture_y / 2) / focal ) * 2\n\n\t\t\n  focal - The parameter sets the focal length of the lens, zooming in and out. Perspective is flattened or exaggerated depending on focal length. See FOV Angle parameter for relation of aperture, focal length and field of view angle. Some interesting distortion effects can be acheived with this parameter.\n\n\n\t\t\n  aperture - This value relates to the area through which light can pass for the camera.\n\n\n\t\n  near - This control allows you to designate the near clipping planes. Geometry closer from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\t\t\n  far - This control allows you to designate the far clipping planes. Geometry further away from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\n  winrollpivot -  - \n\n viewport - camera - legacy -\n\n  win -  - These parameters define the center of the window during the rendering process. The window parameter takes the view and expands it to fit the camera's field of vision. It is important to note that this action is independent of perspective. In other words, it acts as though you are panning the camera without actually moving the camera. The units for this parameter are normalized. That is a  X of -0.5 will move the previous center of the image to the left edge of the render.\n\n winx - winy -\n\t\t\n  winsize - The  Size parameter specifies the dimensions for expanding the view. Similar to  X / Y, this parameter creates a zoom effect by scaling the screen before rendering to the viewport.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n  winroll - This parameter sets the amount, in degrees, the window area rolls. This can be set as a static value or as an aspect that changes over the course of the animation. The roll occurs about the centre of the window.\n\n\n\t\t\n  ipdshift - This is the Interpupillary Distance which applies a translation on the X axis. It is separate from the other translations because when doing things such as a Cube Map rendering, the shift needs to occur after the rotation to the other cube face. If you apply the shift directly in the X translate parameter the cameras will be in the incorrect spot for many of the cube faces.\nTo use the IPD with 2 cameras, the right eye camera should be set with +IPD/2 and the left eye camera to -IPD/2.\n\n\n\t\t\n  projmatrixop - When Custom Projection Matrix is selected, this parameters should be filled in a custom 4x4 projection matrix. For ways to specify a matrix in a parameter, refer to the Matrix Parameters article.  The projection matrix should generate depth values in Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL clip range [-1,1].\n\n\n\n  customproj - Takes a  containing a GLSL shader to specify custom projection functions. You must provide one functions in this shader. As a starting point, here are the definitions for the function that is used when custom ones are not provided. This will only be used when the Render  is rendering a 2D output, not cubemaps or fisheye renders. Note that projection works using Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL's [-1,1]. So the position will be clipped when z is outside the range 0 <= z <= w.\n vec4 UserWorldToProj(vec4 worldSpaceVertPosition, int cameraIndex)\t\t\t\n {\t\t\t\n     vec4 projP = uTDMats[cameraIndex].camProj * worldSpaceVertPosition;\t\t\t\n     return projP;\t\t\t\n }\t\t\t\n\nvec3 TDWorldToProj() will automatically call this at the appropriate point. You can use uniforms/samplers in this shader code by declaring them here and providing them in the GLSL page of the Render TOP.\n\n\n\t\t\n  quadreprojsop - Quad Reprojection is a feature that allows reprojection an arbitrary quad in the scene so that portion of the render where it ends up will be blown up to fill the output of the render. Refer to the Quad Reprojection article for more information about this feature.\n\n\n\n  quadreprojpts -  - Specifies 4 point indices in the  referenced by Quad Reproject  that make up the quad that determines the region to be reprojected. The indices should be listed in bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right order, as viewed from the camera. The  that is referenced should be in the  that is being rendered, so the world transform that will be applied to is can be taken into account.\n\n quadreprojpts1 - quadreprojpts2 - quadreprojpts3 - quadreprojpts4 -\n\n\n\n  bgcolor -  - Sets the background color and alpha of the camera's view.\n\n bgcolorr - bgcolorg - bgcolorb - bgcolora -\n\t\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n  fog -  - This menu determines the type of fog rendered in the viewport: Linear fog uses the following equation:\t\n\t\t\t\nExponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSquared Exponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\n\n\n off - linear - exp - exp2 -\n\t\t\n  fogdensity - A value that specifies density or thickness, used in both exponential fog types. Only non-negative densities are accepted.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fognear - The starting distance of the fog. If geometry is closer to the camera than this distance, fog will not be calculated in the color of the geometry. Used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogfar - The far distance used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogcolor -  - The color of the fog.\n\n fogcolorr - fogcolorg - fogcolorb -\n\t\t\n  fogalpha - Used to control the background opacity of the scene.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogmap - Use a  texture as a color map for the fog.\n\n\n\t\t\n  camlightmask - Allows only specific lights to be used by this camera. This is used in conjunction with the Lights parameter in the Render  to determine what lights are used to illuminate the geometry. When this parameter is left blank, all lights specified in the Render  will be used. Lights specified in this parameter will limit the geometry's lighting with this camera to the light(s)specified assuming the light(s) is also listed in the Render .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Camera  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

      "description": "The Camera  is a 3D object that behaves like a real-world camera. You view your scene through it and render from its point of view using a Render TOP. \nSee Geometry Viewer to learn about how you can inspect a scene from a camera.\nSee cameraViewport in the  - it's a powerful interactive camera that can be used in place of the basic Camera .\nA Camera  can be attached or linked to any other 3D  in a 3D hierarchy.\ncameraCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\n  projection -  - A pop-up menu lets you choose from Perspective and Orthographic projection types. A third option Perpective to Ortho Blend enables the Projection Blend parameter below which can be used to blend between perspectives. A 4th option Custom Projection Matrix allows you to specify a custom 4x4 projection matrix using a tdu.Matrix,  or a .\n\n perspective - ortho - persporthoblend - custommatrix -\n\t\t\n  projectionblend - Blends between perspective projection and orthographic projection when the Projection parameter is set to Perspective to Ortho Blend.\n\n\n\t\t\n  orthowidth - Only active if Orthographic is chosen from the Projection pop-up menu. This specifies the width of the orthographic projection.\n\n\n\t\t\n  viewanglemethod -  - This menu determines which method is used to define the camera's angle of view.\n\n horzfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view horizontally. vertfov - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view vertically. focalaperture - Uses the Focal Length and Aperture parameters below to define the camera's angle of view.\n\t\t\n  fov - The field of view (FOV) angle is the angular extend of the scene imaged by the camera.\nUseful Equations\nField of View and Throw Angle: The FOV would be:\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan( (screenWidth / 2) / (distanceToScreen) ) * 2\nFOV = arctan( 0.5 * (screenWidth / distanceToScreen) ) * 2Throw is:\t\t\t\n\nThrow = distanceToScreen / screenWidth\n1/Throw = screenWidth / distanceToScreenIn terms of throw, it's\t\t\t\n\nFOV = arctan(0.5 * (1/Throw)) * 2\nFOV = arctan(0.5 / Throw) * 2FOV calculations in x and y\nThe above equations can be used to determine FOV_x and FOV_y (ie. horizontally and vertically) using Comera  parameters focal and aperture. In TouchDesigner's Camera , screenWidth = aperture parameter and distanceToScreen = focal parameter (assuming infinity focus), from this \n\nFOV_x = arctan( (aperture / 2) / focal) * 2Furthermore, as mentioned above aperture parameter = aperture_x and if given the resolution in x and y of the rendered view (ie. aspect ratio)\n\naperture_y = resy/resx * aperture_xFrom this\n\nFOV_y = arctan( (aperture_y / 2) / focal ) * 2\n\n\t\t\n  focal - The parameter sets the focal length of the lens, zooming in and out. Perspective is flattened or exaggerated depending on focal length. See FOV Angle parameter for relation of aperture, focal length and field of view angle. Some interesting distortion effects can be acheived with this parameter.\n\n\n\t\t\n  aperture - This value relates to the area through which light can pass for the camera.\n\n\n\t\n  near - This control allows you to designate the near clipping planes. Geometry closer from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\t\t\n  far - This control allows you to designate the far clipping planes. Geometry further away from the lens than these distances will not be visible.\t\nNOTE: If geometry in your scene is producing z-depth artifacts, increase the resolution of the camera's z-depth buffer. To do this, decrease the difference between near and far clipping planes, starting with the near plane.\n\n\n\n  winrollpivot -  - \n\n viewport - camera - legacy -\n\n  win -  - These parameters define the center of the window during the rendering process. The window parameter takes the view and expands it to fit the camera's field of vision. It is important to note that this action is independent of perspective. In other words, it acts as though you are panning the camera without actually moving the camera. The units for this parameter are normalized. That is a  X of -0.5 will move the previous center of the image to the left edge of the render.\n\n winx - winy -\n\t\t\n  winsize - The  Size parameter specifies the dimensions for expanding the view. Similar to  X / Y, this parameter creates a zoom effect by scaling the screen before rendering to the viewport.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n  winroll - This parameter sets the amount, in degrees, the window area rolls. This can be set as a static value or as an aspect that changes over the course of the animation. The roll occurs about the centre of the window.\n\n\n\t\t\n  ipdshift - This is the Interpupillary Distance which applies a translation on the X axis. It is separate from the other translations because when doing things such as a Cube Map rendering, the shift needs to occur after the rotation to the other cube face. If you apply the shift directly in the X translate parameter the cameras will be in the incorrect spot for many of the cube faces.\nTo use the IPD with 2 cameras, the right eye camera should be set with +IPD/2 and the left eye camera to -IPD/2.\n\n\n\t\t\n  projmatrixop - When Custom Projection Matrix is selected, this parameters should be filled in a custom 4x4 projection matrix. For ways to specify a matrix in a parameter, refer to the Matrix Parameters article.  The projection matrix should generate depth values in Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL clip range [-1,1].\n\n\n\n  customproj - Takes a  containing a GLSL shader to specify custom projection functions. You must provide one functions in this shader. As a starting point, here are the definitions for the function that is used when custom ones are not provided. This will only be used when the Render  is rendering a 2D output, not cubemaps or fisheye renders. Note that projection works using Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL's [-1,1]. So the position will be clipped when z is outside the range 0 <= z <= w.\n vec4 UserWorldToProj(vec4 worldSpaceVertPosition, int cameraIndex)\t\t\t\n {\t\t\t\n     vec4 projP = uTDMats[cameraIndex].camProj * worldSpaceVertPosition;\t\t\t\n     return projP;\t\t\t\n }\t\t\t\n\nvec3 TDWorldToProj() will automatically call this at the appropriate point. You can use uniforms/samplers in this shader code by declaring them here and providing them in the GLSL page of the Render TOP.\n\n\n\t\t\n  quadreprojsop - Quad Reprojection is a feature that allows reprojection an arbitrary quad in the scene so that portion of the render where it ends up will be blown up to fill the output of the render. Refer to the Quad Reprojection article for more information about this feature.\n\n\n\n  quadreprojpts -  - Specifies 4 point indices in the  referenced by Quad Reproject  that make up the quad that determines the region to be reprojected. The indices should be listed in bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right order, as viewed from the camera. The  that is referenced should be in the  that is being rendered, so the world transform that will be applied to is can be taken into account.\n\n quadreprojpts1 - quadreprojpts2 - quadreprojpts3 - quadreprojpts4 -\n\n\n\n  bgcolor -  - Sets the background color and alpha of the camera's view.\n\n bgcolorr - bgcolorg - bgcolorb - bgcolora -\n\t\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n  fog -  - This menu determines the type of fog rendered in the viewport: Linear fog uses the following equation:\t\n\t\t\t\nExponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSquared Exponential fog uses the following equation:\t\t\t\n\n\n\n off - linear - exp - exp2 -\n\t\t\n  fogdensity - A value that specifies density or thickness, used in both exponential fog types. Only non-negative densities are accepted.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fognear - The starting distance of the fog. If geometry is closer to the camera than this distance, fog will not be calculated in the color of the geometry. Used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogfar - The far distance used in the linear fog equation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogcolor -  - The color of the fog.\n\n fogcolorr - fogcolorg - fogcolorb -\n\t\t\n  fogalpha - Used to control the background opacity of the scene.\n\n\n\t\t\n  fogmap - Use a  texture as a color map for the fog.\n\n\n\t\t\n  camlightmask - Allows only specific lights to be used by this camera. This is used in conjunction with the Lights parameter in the Render  to determine what lights are used to illuminate the geometry. When this parameter is left blank, all lights specified in the Render  will be used. Lights specified in this parameter will limit the geometry's lighting with this camera to the light(s)specified assuming the light(s) is also listed in the Render .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Camera  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nA built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nHierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nA Window in TouchDesigner is a window in Microsoft Windows or macOS that contains either (1) the TouchDesigner editing interface that exists in Designer Mode, or (2) a user-created Panel inside a Window Component. The user-created windows can span Multiple Monitors borderless, or be floating windows with borders, or popups.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nThe 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the Geometry COMP.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Camera_COMP&oldid=31117\"",

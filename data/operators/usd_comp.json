Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD . You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also File Types.\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a  file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\nTo open a USD file in an USD :\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD  is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build \" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge \" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build \" requires the network to be built again.\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the  file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\nSee also: USD, USD In TouchDesigner, Import Select CHOP, Import Select TOP, Import Select SOP, FBX COMP\nusdCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  file - The path to the USD file. The file can be a binary (.usd or .usdc) or ASCII format (.usda).\n\n\n\n  reload - A pulse to reload the assets from the file without making any changes to the existing network.\n\n\n\n  usematerial - A toggle to specify whether the material/shading be enabled for all the geometry primitives with material binding or not. By turning this toggle on, the  nodes and -according to the need- the ImportSelect TOPs for texture mapping assets are generated.\n\n\n\n  cameras - A toggle to specify whether the Camera nodes (subject to be defined in the USD file) created for the USD  or not.\n\n\n\n  genactors - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs.\n\n\n\n  mergegeo - A toggle to merge the mergeable geometries SOPs and their transformation COMPs up to a specified merge level. This feature can noticeably increase the performance of the USD  network.\n\n\n\n  mergelevel - Defines the desired merge level for merging the nodes. The start value is 1 which is the root of the network and it increases for the children of nodes the same as their positions within tree hierarchy. By default, this parameter is disabled and can be enabled once the toggle for Merge Geometry is set to ON.\n\n\n\n  maxwiredchildren - This value is used to define how many wired children a /Null  node can have on the same network level (note that this network level refers to all the nodes that can be seen on the same canvas network). If a node has more children than this value, all its children will be relocated inside of it. This is used to prune out the wired children nodes of a parent node to make a lighter and cleaner network. The default value is 5.\n\n\n\n  computenormals - A toggle for generating normal vectors from subdivision schema specified from USD file using OpenSubdiv library. Turning this toggle to OFF makes will make the SOPs use the TouchDesigner generated normal instead (only CPU mode).\n\n\n\n  gpudirect - A toggle to load the geometry directly to the . This makes the rendering much faster than CPU mode. However, currently the only supported geometries are mesh and point primitives. If a USD scene contains other prim types such as NURBs Patches, an error will be generated for each Import Select SOP that is not supported.\n\n\n\n  buildnetwork - Every time (including the first time) you specify a new file, or change any parameter from the USD page, you need to re-build it, so it generates the network according to the current selected parameters.\n\n\n\n  keepparams - A toggle to keep the parameters of the current network over parameters of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  keepconnections - A toggle to keep the connection of the current network over the connections of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  update - Updates the network. This option is specifically useful when the USD file is edited after the USD network is imported in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\n  callbacks - The Callbacks  will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n\n  shiftanimationstart - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the USD file.\n\n\n\n  sampleratemode -  - A menu to choose between the file  or custom sample rate.\n\n filefps - uses the  from what is defined in the USD file. custom - uses a desired value specified by  parameter.\n\n  samplerate - It is used to specify the sample rate () for the animation. This parameter is disabled by default and can be enabled once the Custom option is selected from the  Menu.\n\n\n\n  playmode -  - A menu to specify the method used to play the animation.\n\n lockedtotimeline - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline. The parameters Play, Speed, Index, Cue and Cue , are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to animation position. specifyindex - This mode allows the user to specify a particular index (position) in the animation using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the animation. sequential - This mode continually plays regardless of the timeline position (the Index parameter is disabled). Play, Speed, Cue, and Cue  parameters below are enabled to allow some control. The default is set to this value.\n\n  initialize - Resets the animation to its initial state.\n\n\n\n  start - Resets the animation to its initial state and starts playback.\n\n\n\n  cue - A toggle to jump to Cue  when it’s set to ON and it stays at that position. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.\n\n\n\n  cuepulse - When pressed the animation jumps to the Cue  and continues from that point.\n\n\n\n  cuepoint - Set any index in the animation as a point to jump to.\n\n\n\n  cuepointunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Cue . Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  play - A toggle that makes the animation to play when it sets to ON. This Parameter is only available/enabled if the Sequential mode is selected from the Play Mode.\n\n\n\n  index - This parameter explicitly sets the animation position when Play Mode is set to Specify Index. The units’ menu on the right lets you specify the index in the following units: Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  indexunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Index. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  speed - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is Sequential. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on.\n\n\n\n  trim - A toggle to enable the Trim Start and Trim End parameters.\n\n\n\n  tstart - Sets an in point from the beginning of the animation, allowing you to trim the starting index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tstartunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim Start. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  tend - Sets an end point from the end of the movie, allowing you to trim the ending index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tendunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim End. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  textendleft -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n  textendright -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the USD  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nEvery component contains a network of operators that create and modify data.

This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping Time your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.\n\n\n\nEach SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types.

Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD . You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also File Types.\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a  file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\nTo open a USD file in an USD :\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD  is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build \" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge \" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build \" requires the network to be built again.\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the  file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\nSee also: USD, USD In TouchDesigner, Import Select CHOP, Import Select TOP, Import Select SOP, FBX COMP\nusdCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  file - The path to the USD file. The file can be a binary (.usd or .usdc) or ASCII format (.usda).\n\n\n\n  reload - A pulse to reload the assets from the file without making any changes to the existing network.\n\n\n\n  usematerial - A toggle to specify whether the material/shading be enabled for all the geometry primitives with material binding or not. By turning this toggle on, the  nodes and -according to the need- the ImportSelect TOPs for texture mapping assets are generated.\n\n\n\n  cameras - A toggle to specify whether the Camera nodes (subject to be defined in the USD file) created for the USD  or not.\n\n\n\n  genactors - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs.\n\n\n\n  mergegeo - A toggle to merge the mergeable geometries SOPs and their transformation COMPs up to a specified merge level. This feature can noticeably increase the performance of the USD  network.\n\n\n\n  mergelevel - Defines the desired merge level for merging the nodes. The start value is 1 which is the root of the network and it increases for the children of nodes the same as their positions within tree hierarchy. By default, this parameter is disabled and can be enabled once the toggle for Merge Geometry is set to ON.\n\n\n\n  maxwiredchildren - This value is used to define how many wired children a /Null  node can have on the same network level (note that this network level refers to all the nodes that can be seen on the same canvas network). If a node has more children than this value, all its children will be relocated inside of it. This is used to prune out the wired children nodes of a parent node to make a lighter and cleaner network. The default value is 5.\n\n\n\n  computenormals - A toggle for generating normal vectors from subdivision schema specified from USD file using OpenSubdiv library. Turning this toggle to OFF makes will make the SOPs use the TouchDesigner generated normal instead (only CPU mode).\n\n\n\n  gpudirect - A toggle to load the geometry directly to the . This makes the rendering much faster than CPU mode. However, currently the only supported geometries are mesh and point primitives. If a USD scene contains other prim types such as NURBs Patches, an error will be generated for each Import Select SOP that is not supported.\n\n\n\n  buildnetwork - Every time (including the first time) you specify a new file, or change any parameter from the USD page, you need to re-build it, so it generates the network according to the current selected parameters.\n\n\n\n  keepparams - A toggle to keep the parameters of the current network over parameters of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  keepconnections - A toggle to keep the connection of the current network over the connections of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  update - Updates the network. This option is specifically useful when the USD file is edited after the USD network is imported in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\n  callbacks - The Callbacks  will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n\n  shiftanimationstart - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the USD file.\n\n\n\n  sampleratemode -  - A menu to choose between the file  or custom sample rate.\n\n filefps - uses the  from what is defined in the USD file. custom - uses a desired value specified by  parameter.\n\n  samplerate - It is used to specify the sample rate () for the animation. This parameter is disabled by default and can be enabled once the Custom option is selected from the  Menu.\n\n\n\n  playmode -  - A menu to specify the method used to play the animation.\n\n lockedtotimeline - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline. The parameters Play, Speed, Index, Cue and Cue , are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to animation position. specifyindex - This mode allows the user to specify a particular index (position) in the animation using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the animation. sequential - This mode continually plays regardless of the timeline position (the Index parameter is disabled). Play, Speed, Cue, and Cue  parameters below are enabled to allow some control. The default is set to this value.\n\n  initialize - Resets the animation to its initial state.\n\n\n\n  start - Resets the animation to its initial state and starts playback.\n\n\n\n  cue - A toggle to jump to Cue  when it’s set to ON and it stays at that position. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.\n\n\n\n  cuepulse - When pressed the animation jumps to the Cue  and continues from that point.\n\n\n\n  cuepoint - Set any index in the animation as a point to jump to.\n\n\n\n  cuepointunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Cue . Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  play - A toggle that makes the animation to play when it sets to ON. This Parameter is only available/enabled if the Sequential mode is selected from the Play Mode.\n\n\n\n  index - This parameter explicitly sets the animation position when Play Mode is set to Specify Index. The units’ menu on the right lets you specify the index in the following units: Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  indexunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Index. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  speed - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is Sequential. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on.\n\n\n\n  trim - A toggle to enable the Trim Start and Trim End parameters.\n\n\n\n  tstart - Sets an in point from the beginning of the animation, allowing you to trim the starting index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tstartunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim Start. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  tend - Sets an end point from the end of the movie, allowing you to trim the ending index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tendunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim End. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  textendleft -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n  textendright -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the USD  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping Time your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.\n\n\n\nEach SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nHierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=USD_COMP&oldid=30697\"\n\t\tCategory: COMPs",

      "description": "The USD  loads and imports most geometric schemas from a USD file in crate/binary or ASCII file formats with extensions as (.usd), (.usda), (.usdc), and (.usdz). Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD . You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also File Types.\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \".tdc\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \".tdc\" file using Import Select OPs (Import Select TOP / Import Select SOP / Import Select CHOP). Upon reloading a  file, the assets can be imported directly from the \".tdc\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \".tdc\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \".tdc\" will be saved out.\nTo open a USD file in an USD :\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD  is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build \" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge \" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build \" requires the network to be built again.\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the  file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\nSee also: USD, USD In TouchDesigner, Import Select CHOP, Import Select TOP, Import Select SOP, FBX COMP\nusdCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  file - The path to the USD file. The file can be a binary (.usd or .usdc) or ASCII format (.usda).\n\n\n\n  reload - A pulse to reload the assets from the file without making any changes to the existing network.\n\n\n\n  usematerial - A toggle to specify whether the material/shading be enabled for all the geometry primitives with material binding or not. By turning this toggle on, the  nodes and -according to the need- the ImportSelect TOPs for texture mapping assets are generated.\n\n\n\n  cameras - A toggle to specify whether the Camera nodes (subject to be defined in the USD file) created for the USD  or not.\n\n\n\n  genactors - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs.\n\n\n\n  mergegeo - A toggle to merge the mergeable geometries SOPs and their transformation COMPs up to a specified merge level. This feature can noticeably increase the performance of the USD  network.\n\n\n\n  mergelevel - Defines the desired merge level for merging the nodes. The start value is 1 which is the root of the network and it increases for the children of nodes the same as their positions within tree hierarchy. By default, this parameter is disabled and can be enabled once the toggle for Merge Geometry is set to ON.\n\n\n\n  maxwiredchildren - This value is used to define how many wired children a /Null  node can have on the same network level (note that this network level refers to all the nodes that can be seen on the same canvas network). If a node has more children than this value, all its children will be relocated inside of it. This is used to prune out the wired children nodes of a parent node to make a lighter and cleaner network. The default value is 5.\n\n\n\n  computenormals - A toggle for generating normal vectors from subdivision schema specified from USD file using OpenSubdiv library. Turning this toggle to OFF makes will make the SOPs use the TouchDesigner generated normal instead (only CPU mode).\n\n\n\n  gpudirect - A toggle to load the geometry directly to the . This makes the rendering much faster than CPU mode. However, currently the only supported geometries are mesh and point primitives. If a USD scene contains other prim types such as NURBs Patches, an error will be generated for each Import Select SOP that is not supported.\n\n\n\n  buildnetwork - Every time (including the first time) you specify a new file, or change any parameter from the USD page, you need to re-build it, so it generates the network according to the current selected parameters.\n\n\n\n  keepparams - A toggle to keep the parameters of the current network over parameters of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  keepconnections - A toggle to keep the connection of the current network over the connections of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n\n\n\n  update - Updates the network. This option is specifically useful when the USD file is edited after the USD network is imported in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\n  callbacks - The Callbacks  will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n\n  shiftanimationstart - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the USD file.\n\n\n\n  sampleratemode -  - A menu to choose between the file  or custom sample rate.\n\n filefps - uses the  from what is defined in the USD file. custom - uses a desired value specified by  parameter.\n\n  samplerate - It is used to specify the sample rate () for the animation. This parameter is disabled by default and can be enabled once the Custom option is selected from the  Menu.\n\n\n\n  playmode -  - A menu to specify the method used to play the animation.\n\n lockedtotimeline - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline. The parameters Play, Speed, Index, Cue and Cue , are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to animation position. specifyindex - This mode allows the user to specify a particular index (position) in the animation using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the animation. sequential - This mode continually plays regardless of the timeline position (the Index parameter is disabled). Play, Speed, Cue, and Cue  parameters below are enabled to allow some control. The default is set to this value.\n\n  initialize - Resets the animation to its initial state.\n\n\n\n  start - Resets the animation to its initial state and starts playback.\n\n\n\n  cue - A toggle to jump to Cue  when it’s set to ON and it stays at that position. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.\n\n\n\n  cuepulse - When pressed the animation jumps to the Cue  and continues from that point.\n\n\n\n  cuepoint - Set any index in the animation as a point to jump to.\n\n\n\n  cuepointunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Cue . Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  play - A toggle that makes the animation to play when it sets to ON. This Parameter is only available/enabled if the Sequential mode is selected from the Play Mode.\n\n\n\n  index - This parameter explicitly sets the animation position when Play Mode is set to Specify Index. The units’ menu on the right lets you specify the index in the following units: Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  indexunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Index. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  speed - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is Sequential. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on.\n\n\n\n  trim - A toggle to enable the Trim Start and Trim End parameters.\n\n\n\n  tstart - Sets an in point from the beginning of the animation, allowing you to trim the starting index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tstartunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim Start. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  tend - Sets an end point from the end of the movie, allowing you to trim the ending index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).\n\n\n\n  tendunit -  - Specifies a unit type for Trim End. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.\n\n frames - seconds - fraction - indices -\n\n  textendleft -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n  textendright -  - Determines how USD  handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n\n hold - cycle - mirror -\n\n\n\nThe Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.\n\n  xord -  - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your  will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  rord -  - This allows you to set the transform order for the 's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the 's rotations take place will alter the 's final position.\tA Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx\n\n xyz - R = Rz * Ry * Rx xzy - R = Ry * Rz * Rx yxz - R = Rz * Rx * Ry yzx - R = Rx * Rz * Ry zxy - R = Ry * Rx * Rz zyx - R = Rx * Ry * Rz\n\n  t -  - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\n  r -  - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n rx - ry - rz -\n\n  s -  - This specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the  in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n\n sx - sy - sz -\n\n  p -  - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a  scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a  produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the .\t\nFor example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an  is located at -1, -1, 0 and you wanted to scale the  by 0.5 (reduce its size by 50%), the  would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above, rotations performed on an  with different pivot points produce very different results.\n\n\n px - py - pz -\n\n  scale - This field allows you to change the size of an  uniformly along the three axes.\t\n Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.\n\n\n\n  parentxformsrc -  - Select what position is used as the transform source for this obejct. Can be one of \"Parent ()\", \"Specify Parent \", or \"World Origin\".\n\n hierarchy - specify - worldorigin -\n\n  parentobject - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.\n\n\n\n  lookat - Allows you to orient this  by naming another 3D  you would like it to , or point to. Once you have designated this  to look at, it will continue to face that , even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another 's movements. The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n\n\n\n  forwarddir -  - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.\n\n posx - negx - posy - negy - posz - negz -\n\n  lookup -  - When specifying a , it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat , for example, passes through the Y axis of the target .\t\n - Use this option if the look at  does not pass through the Y axis of the target .\n - This precisely defines the rotates on the  doing the looking. The  specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See  below.\n - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.\n off - on - quat - roll -\n\n  pathsop - Names the  that functions as the path you want this  to move along. For instance, you can name a  that provides a path for the camera to follow.\n\n\n\n  roll - Using the angle control you can specify a 's rotation as it animates along the path.\n\n\n\n  pos - This parameter lets you specify the  of the  along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from 0 to 1, where 0 equals the starting point and 1 equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as 10 for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n\n\n\n  pathorient - If this option is selected, the  will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the  will be pointing down the path.\n\n\n\n  up -  - When orienting a , the  is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.\n\n upx - upy - upz -\n\n  bank - The  rolls the  based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another Object as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the Xform page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be preXForm * xform * Position.\n\n  pxform - Enables the transformation on this page.\n\n\n\n  pxord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  prord -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n xyz - xzy - yxz - yzx - zxy - zyx -\n\n  pt -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ptx - pty - ptz -\n\n  pr -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n prx - pry - prz -\n\n  ps -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n psx - psy - psz -\n\n  pp -  - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n ppx - ppy - ppz -\n\n  pscale - Refer to the documentation on Xform page for more information.\n\n\n\n  preset - This button will reset this page's transform so it has no translate/rotate/scale.\n\n\n\n  pcommit - This button will copy the transform from this page to the main Xform page, and reset this page's transform.\n\n\n\n  xformmatrixop - This parameter can be used to transform using a 4x4 matrix directly. For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the Matrix Parameters page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix * PreXForm * Position.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found.

For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the USD  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002019.146502018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nEvery component contains a network of operators that create and modify data. The operators are connected by wires that define where data is routed after the operator cooks its inputs and generates an output.\n\n\n\nThe 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the Geometry COMP.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at. Set with project.cookRate.\n\n\n\nThe panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping Time your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.\n\n\n\nEach SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon Primitive is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nHierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=USD_COMP&oldid=30697\"",

The  parameter points the  in question at the other 's origin.\t\n To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null  and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null , and tell the camera to look at this  using the  parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null  with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null , enable the Null 's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.",

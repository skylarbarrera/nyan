The higher the quality, the more computationally expensive it is.\n\n low - medium -\n\t\t\n  sampledirs - For each pixel, rays are sent out in random directions to see if there is a surface nearby that would occlude the ambient light to this pixel. This parameter controls how many rays are sent out per pixel.\n\n\n\t\t\n  samplesteps - Since this is a 2D pixel-based operation, the rays need to sample multiple neighboring pixels along its path to check for points of interest. This parameter controls how many of these samples each ray does.\n\n\n\t\t\n  surfaceavoid - This parameter biases the angle of the rays so they don't travel too close to the plane that the starting point lays on (as determined by the point's normal).\n\n\n\t\t\n  ssaopassres -  - The SSAO pass can be set to Full, Half, or Quarter the resolution of the input image.\n\n full - half - quarter -\n\t\t\n  ssaoradius - The distance it searches from the current point for occluders (in object space units).\n\n\n\t\t\n  contrast - Controls the contrast of the SSAO contribution.\n\n\n\t\t\n  attenuation - Controls the attenuation of the ambient lighting.\n\n\n\t\t\n  edgethresh - To avoid the ambient occlusion from bleeding across the edges of objects onto other objects, an edge detect is done using the depth buffer to figure where one object ends and the next one begins.

      "description": "The SSAO  performs Screen Space Ambient Occlusion on the output of a Render TOP or Render Pass TOP. Because this technique requires access to the Depth Buffer, no other  can be in between the Render/RenderPass  and the SSAO . Screen Space Ambient Occlusion is a real-time rendering trick that creates an approximation of ambient occlusion by using the Depth Buffer of the rendered scene. It is done as 2D post-processes, so the complexity of the scene has no bearing on how expensive it is. This is in comparison to true ambient occlusion which becomes more expensive with each new object that is rendered. There are two parts to a SSAO technique. First a SSAO pass is done that determines how much ambient occlusion each pixel is affected by. This result tends to be very noisy. A blur operation is then performed to even out this noise.\nssaoTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  quality -  - Determines the visual quality of the results. The higher the quality, the more computationally expensive it is.\n\n low - medium -\n\t\t\n  sampledirs - For each pixel, rays are sent out in random directions to see if there is a surface nearby that would occlude the ambient light to this pixel. This parameter controls how many rays are sent out per pixel.\n\n\n\t\t\n  samplesteps - Since this is a 2D pixel-based operation, the rays need to sample multiple neighboring pixels along its path to check for points of interest. This parameter controls how many of these samples each ray does.\n\n\n\t\t\n  surfaceavoid - This parameter biases the angle of the rays so they don't travel too close to the plane that the starting point lays on (as determined by the point's normal).\n\n\n\t\t\n  ssaopassres -  - The SSAO pass can be set to Full, Half, or Quarter the resolution of the input image.\n\n full - half - quarter -\n\t\t\n  ssaoradius - The distance it searches from the current point for occluders (in object space units).\n\n\n\t\t\n  contrast - Controls the contrast of the SSAO contribution.\n\n\n\t\t\n  attenuation - Controls the attenuation of the ambient lighting.\n\n\n\t\t\n  edgethresh - To avoid the ambient occlusion from bleeding across the edges of objects onto other objects, an edge detect is done using the depth buffer to figure where one object ends and the next one begins. This parameter controls how sensitive the edge detection is.\n\n\n\t\t\n  blurradius - The amount of blur in pixels.\n\n\n\t\t\n  blursharpness - Controls the sharpness of the blur operation.\n\n\n\t\t\n  combinewithcolor - By default the final ambient occlusion result will be multiplied by the color output of the Render . You can just output the ambient occlusion results by turning this parameter off.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

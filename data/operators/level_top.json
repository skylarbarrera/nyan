See also the Luma Level TOP which preserves hue and saturation more accurately, but is slower.\t\nThe Level 's features have been built into one  to maximize performance in a single pass. It takes all its parameters to make a lookup table on the CPU, so animating parameters in the Level  will decrease its performance as the lookup table is recreated each frame that a parameter changes.\nlevelTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  clampinput -  - This option will clamp pixel values in between 0 and 1. When using higher bit depth floating pixel formats, it is recommended to set it to Unclamped to allow the full range of values to be operated on. Auto should detect the pixel format as set accordingly.\n\n automatic - Detects pixel format and clamps if 8-bit fixed or leaves unclamped for floating point pixel formats. clamp - Clamps data to values between 0 and 1. Recommended for 8-bit fixed default pixel format for better performance. unclamped - No clamping of data, use for higher bit-depth pixel formats.\n\t\n  invert - Inverts the colors in the image. Black becomes white, white becomes black. Colors invert across the color wheel, so red becomes cyan, blue becomes yellow, green becomes magenta, and so on.\n\n\n\t\n  blacklevel - Any pixel with a value less than or equal to this will be black.\n\n\n\t\n  brightness1 - Increases or decreases the brightness of an image. Brightness can be considered the arithmetic mean of the RGB channels. The Brightness parameter adds or subtracts an offset into the R, G, and B channels. Low brightness will result in dark tones, while high brightness will wash the color out towards white.\n\n\n\t\n  gamma1 - The Gamma parameter applies a gamma correction to the image. Gamma is the relationship between the brightness of a pixel as it appears on the screen, and the numerical value of that pixel. This is often represented by a gamma curve. The difference between brightness and gamma is that gamma also affects the ratio of red to green to blue. A straight, linear gamma curve with a value of 1 means no change.\n\n\n\t\n  contrast - Contrast applies a scale factor (gain) to the RGB channels. Increasing contrast will brighten the light areas and darken the dark areas of the image, making the difference between the light and dark areas of the image stronger.\n\n\n\n\n\n  inlow - Any pixel below this value appears black.\n\n\n\t\n  inhigh - Any pixel above this value appears white.\n\n\n\t\n  outlow - Clamps pixel values to this value or higher.\n\n\n\t\n  outhigh - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n  lowr - Clamps the minimum level of the red channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highr - Clamps the maximum level of the red channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowg - Clamps the minimum level of the green channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highg - Clamps the maximum level of the green channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowb - Clamps the minimum level of the blue channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highb - Clamps the maximum level of the blue channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowa - Clamps the minimum level of the alpha channel.\n\n\n\t\n  higha - Clamps the maximum level of the alpha channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  stepping - Turns on stepping (posterizing) and enables the parameters below.\n\n\n\t\n  stepsize - Posterizes the image into bands or stripes. Number of bands equal to the inverse of this parameter (i.e., 0.25 = 4 bands). Use a default Ramp  to easily see this parameter's effect.\n\n\n\t\n  threshold - Offsets the position of the step boundaries.\n\n\n\t\n  clamplow - Clamps the image's minimum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  clamphigh - Clamps the image's maximum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  soften - Softens or blends the boundaries between steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n  gamma2 - A second gamma correction that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.\n\n\n\t\n  opacity - Adjust the opacity, or transparency, of the image.\n\n\n\t\n  brightness2 - A second brightness adjustment that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.\n\n\n\t\n  clamp - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.\n\n\n\t\n  clamplow2 - Clamps the image's minimum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  clamphigh2 - Clamps the image's maximum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option makes the color channels pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

      "description": "The Level  adjusts image contrast, brightness, gamma, black level, color range, quantization, opacity and more. See also the Luma Level TOP which preserves hue and saturation more accurately, but is slower.\t\nThe Level 's features have been built into one  to maximize performance in a single pass. It takes all its parameters to make a lookup table on the CPU, so animating parameters in the Level  will decrease its performance as the lookup table is recreated each frame that a parameter changes.\nlevelTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  clampinput -  - This option will clamp pixel values in between 0 and 1. When using higher bit depth floating pixel formats, it is recommended to set it to Unclamped to allow the full range of values to be operated on. Auto should detect the pixel format as set accordingly.\n\n automatic - Detects pixel format and clamps if 8-bit fixed or leaves unclamped for floating point pixel formats. clamp - Clamps data to values between 0 and 1. Recommended for 8-bit fixed default pixel format for better performance. unclamped - No clamping of data, use for higher bit-depth pixel formats.\n\t\n  invert - Inverts the colors in the image. Black becomes white, white becomes black. Colors invert across the color wheel, so red becomes cyan, blue becomes yellow, green becomes magenta, and so on.\n\n\n\t\n  blacklevel - Any pixel with a value less than or equal to this will be black.\n\n\n\t\n  brightness1 - Increases or decreases the brightness of an image. Brightness can be considered the arithmetic mean of the RGB channels. The Brightness parameter adds or subtracts an offset into the R, G, and B channels. Low brightness will result in dark tones, while high brightness will wash the color out towards white.\n\n\n\t\n  gamma1 - The Gamma parameter applies a gamma correction to the image. Gamma is the relationship between the brightness of a pixel as it appears on the screen, and the numerical value of that pixel. This is often represented by a gamma curve. The difference between brightness and gamma is that gamma also affects the ratio of red to green to blue. A straight, linear gamma curve with a value of 1 means no change.\n\n\n\t\n  contrast - Contrast applies a scale factor (gain) to the RGB channels. Increasing contrast will brighten the light areas and darken the dark areas of the image, making the difference between the light and dark areas of the image stronger.\n\n\n\n\n\n  inlow - Any pixel below this value appears black.\n\n\n\t\n  inhigh - Any pixel above this value appears white.\n\n\n\t\n  outlow - Clamps pixel values to this value or higher.\n\n\n\t\n  outhigh - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.\n\n\n\n\n\n  lowr - Clamps the minimum level of the red channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highr - Clamps the maximum level of the red channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowg - Clamps the minimum level of the green channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highg - Clamps the maximum level of the green channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowb - Clamps the minimum level of the blue channel.\n\n\n\t\n  highb - Clamps the maximum level of the blue channel.\n\n\n\t\n  lowa - Clamps the minimum level of the alpha channel.\n\n\n\t\n  higha - Clamps the maximum level of the alpha channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  stepping - Turns on stepping (posterizing) and enables the parameters below.\n\n\n\t\n  stepsize - Posterizes the image into bands or stripes. Number of bands equal to the inverse of this parameter (i.e., 0.25 = 4 bands). Use a default Ramp  to easily see this parameter's effect.\n\n\n\t\n  threshold - Offsets the position of the step boundaries.\n\n\n\t\n  clamplow - Clamps the image's minimum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  clamphigh - Clamps the image's maximum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  soften - Softens or blends the boundaries between steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n  gamma2 - A second gamma correction that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.\n\n\n\t\n  opacity - Adjust the opacity, or transparency, of the image.\n\n\n\t\n  brightness2 - A second brightness adjustment that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.\n\n\n\t\n  clamp - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.\n\n\n\t\n  clamplow2 - Clamps the image's minimum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  clamphigh2 - Clamps the image's maximum value. (value as in hue, saturation, and value)\n\n\n\t\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option makes the color channels pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Level  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.

TouchDesigner can act as a client and another computer needs to act as a MQTT Server.  Once a client establishes a connection with a server, it can do two things: \t\t\n\nSend a message to the server to express interest in any data that has a specific \"topic\" string. This is called \"subscribing\". Then the MQTT Client  will receive all messages that the server gets with that topic.\nInform the server that it will send messages to the server with a certain topic string, and then send messages with that topic. The messages then get forward to any client that has expressed interest in that topic.See also MQTT, TCP/IP DAT.\nmqttclientDAT_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Enable the connection.\n\n\n\t\t\n  netaddress - The address of the broker to connect to.

A \"table\" is one of the two forms of DATs (the other being simply lines of \"free-form\" text via the Text DAT). \t\nManually editing cells - When a  has its Viewer Active on, you can add rows and columns by right-clicking on row 0 or column 0 to add rows/columns, and typing text into any cell of its node viewer. Use the Tab key to jump to the next cell, and the up/down arrow keys to navigate to adjacent cells.\nProcedurally filling cells - You can conveniently create and fill rows and columns of a table. On the Fill page, the Fill Type menu gives 5 options: Manual, Set Size, Set Size and Contents, Fill by Column, and Fill by Row. When a Fill option is chosen, you can generate multiple rows/columns with specific headings using space-separated names or an expression, plus expressions to fill the cells. \nYou can use me.subRow and me.subCol (for sub-section being filled) in your expressions. See the popup menu on the Cell  parameter for suggestions.\nClick the + below the parameters to you generate multiple sets of new cols or rows.\nFilling cells externally with python  - If you are not auto-filling, you can put strings into table cells using something like op('table1')[2,'select'] = 'yes' in a python script elsewhere, or append rows using .appendRow() in python. See also the Script DAT and its .\t\nLoading from external files - The  can also can load a table from a .csv, .txt or .dat file on disk or on the web.

      "description": "The Trigger  starts an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger pulses in the input channels. A trigger point occurs whenever the first input's channel increases across the trigger threshold value. Most commonly, an ADSR starts when the input goes from 0 to 1.\t\t\nNote: To get a channel with the full waveform, turn off the  parameter on the Common page, and don't connect an input. \nThe envelope consists of six major sections: delay, attack, peak, decay, sustain and release.\t\t\t\nFrom the time the threshold is reached and while the channel's value is above the release threshold, the envelope is in its sustain phase during which it will delay, attack, peak-hold, decay and then maintain its sustain value.\t\t\t\nAfter the inputs drops below the release threshold, the envelope start its release phase and will drop to 0.\t\t\t\nThe peak and sustain levels can be set independently, but peak value can never be less than sustain.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThis  works with both time-sliced inputs or with static input channels.\nFor jittery inputs, if you don't want it to trigger until its input has been On for some period, see the OP Snippets for the Trigger , example \"trigger after a time threshold\", which uses the Count .\nNote: See examples in OP .\t\t\t\nSee also: Timer CHOP, Count CHOP, Speed CHOP, Event CHOP\ntriggerCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  threshold - If on, the trigger and release thresholds are the same value.\n\n\n\t\t\n  threshup - The trigger threshold (see above).\n\n\n\t\t\n  threshdown - The release threshold (see above).\n\n\n\t\t\n  retrigger - The amount of time after a trigger point that a new trigger may occur.\n\n\n\t\t\n  retriggerunit - \n\n\n\t\t\n  mintrigger - The minimum amount of time that the trigger will remain active.\n\n\n\t\t\n  mintriggerunit - \n\n\n\t\t\n  triggeron -  - Determines whether a trigger occurs on an increasing slope or decreasing slope when passing the trigger threshold.

In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nOP Snippets  is a set of 700+ live examples of TouchDesigner operators. You can access snippets via the Help menu, or by right-clicking on network operators, or r-clicking on OP Create dialog items.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Trigger_CHOP&oldid=31078\"",

It is also used to decrease the number of CVs within a given tolerance (i.e. a simple but fast method of data reduction).\t\t\n\n\nRefinement and unrefinement work both on faces (polygons, Bzier curves and NURBS curves) and surfaces (primitive meshes, Bzier surfaces and NURBS surfaces). To unrefine a face or a surface you need to specify a parametric interval (not just a single value as in refinement). This allows you to unrefine primitives within arbitrary intervals, either locally or globally. For example, to unrefine the whole primitive choose 0 and 1 as the two parametric boundaries; [0,0.5] will unrefine only the first parametric half of the primitive.\t\t\t\nThe interval boundaries are given by the First/Second U/V fields. Since refinement does not need an interval, the Second U/V fields are disabled by default.\t\t\t\nThe Tolerance control is only available for unrefinement, and not for refinement. Refinement does not need tolerances because it generates a curve or a surface that is mathematically identical to the original. Unrefinement, however, may tend to smooth out (or \"melt\") the original in a given area. In short, unrefinement is lossy; refinement isn't.\nrefineSOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  group - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this  to act only upon the group specified.

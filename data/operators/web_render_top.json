This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nThe Frames-per-Second that TouchDesigner's Timeline runs at.

      "description": "The Web Render  takes a URL or  and renders a webpage via a separate browser process that uses Chromium Embedded Frameworks, and passes the result back through shared memory. It renders non-Flash pages, including HTML, HTML5, PDF, SVG and more. Targets can be on the internet, in local files with a file:// syntax, or a DAT.\t\nIt is implemented with the Chromium Embedded Frameworks project (CEF).\t\t\nAttach an Info CHOP to get the loaded status loaded of the page, and num_handle_updates, the number of times the page has been rendered.\t\t\nAttach an Info DAT to get the shared memory handle, the status of the browser process, the process_id, versions for Chromium Embedded Frameworks cef and Chromium chromium, the url currently displayed, page title and error state of the process.\t\t\nSee also Palette:webBrowser, Audio Web Render CHOP, Palette:SVG\nwebrenderTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Enables/disables the Web Render .\n\n\n\t\n  source - Source of the webpage, which can be an address via URL or File, or data from a \n\n\n\n  url - Uniform Resource Locator or the address of the web page\n\n\n\n  dat - \n\n\n\n  reloadsrc - Reload source , URL or File.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reload - Reloads the current page, the same as refreshing a web browser.\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetcount - Reset the counter for the number of times the webpage has been updated (available via an Info ).\n\n\n\t\n  updatewhenloaded - Only shows the web page when it is full loaded.\n\n\n\t\n  alwayscook -  every frame if on.  If off, the Web Render  will cook for a 10 additional frames after the last update received to maintain continuity.\n\n\n\t\t\n  transparent - Loads the webpage with a transparent background.  This option will restart the browser process.\n\n\n\t\n  audio -  - Let the browser process play audio if the web page contains audio.  This option will restart the browser process.\n\n off - Sound disabled. system - Redirect to system audio out. audiochop - Redirect to Audio Web Render CHOPs\n\t\n  mediastream, - Allows the web render instance to use the mic and the camera\n\n\n\t\n  maxrenderrate - Sets the maximum frame rate the page will be rendered at.

This option will restart the browser process.  A list of options for the chromium browser can be found at here.  Note that these options may change without notice with version updates.\n\n\n\t\n  autorestart - Automatically restart the browser process if it died.\n\n\n\t\n  autorestartpulse - Triggers the Restart immediately on button release (button-up). This can be accessed in python using the pulse() method.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear.

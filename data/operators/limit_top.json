Several different methods are available to determine what happens to values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range.\nQuantizing pixel values will snap each channel to the closest allowable value (the \"quantized values\"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.\nQuantizing pixel positions will cause all pixels within the quantization step to take the same value.

      "description": "The Limit  can limit the pixel values of the input image to fall between a minimum and maximum value, and can quantize the pixels by value or position.\nLimiting a channel causes all of its values to lie within the given range. Several different methods are available to determine what happens to values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range.\nQuantizing pixel values will snap each channel to the closest allowable value (the \"quantized values\"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.\nQuantizing pixel positions will cause all pixels within the quantization step to take the same value. This is equivalent to lowering the image resolution and then scaling the image back to its original size with no filtering applied.\nlimitTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  minop -  - The wrapping method used when applying limits to the pixel values in the image.\n\n off - No limits are applied to the pixel values. clamp - Pixel values are constrained to the ranged defined by the Minimum and Maximum parameters. Values outside of the range are replaced with the Minimum or Maximum value. loop - Values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range continue at the other end of the interval e.g. as values go above the Maximum they loop back and start again at the Minimum value. zigzag - When values go beyond the Minimum or Maximum values they mirror back towards the other end of the range e.g. when a value goes above the maximum it flips and starts going back to the minimum.\n\n  maxop -  - The wrapping method used when applying limits to the pixel values in the image.\n\n off - No limits are applied to the pixel values. clamp - Pixel values are constrained to the ranged defined by the Minimum and Maximum parameters. Values outside of the range are replaced with the Minimum or Maximum value. loop - Values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range continue at the other end of the interval e.g. as values go above the Maximum they loop back and start again at the Minimum value. zigzag - When values go beyond the Minimum or Maximum values they mirror back towards the other end of the range e.g. when a value goes above the maximum it flips and starts going back to the minimum.\n\n  min - The minimum value that any of the channels in the output image can have.\n\n\n\n  max - The maximum value that any of the channels in the output image can have.\n\n\n\n  positive - Apply an absolute value function after all other limits and quantizations are calculated e.g. all negatives are made positive.\n\n\n\n  norm - Normalize values in the output image so that they are all scaled and shifted to fall between the Normalized Minimum and Maximum (0 to 1 by default). This operation requires multiple internal render passes and is slightly slower than other limit operations. Normalization is done after all other limits and quantizations are applied.\n\n\n\n  normmin - The minimum value for pixels after normalization.\n\n\n\n  normmax - The maximum value for pixels after normalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n  quantvalue -  - The function used to quantize the pixel values in the output image.\n\n off - Pixel values are not quantized. ceiling - Pixel values are rounded up to the nearest quantization step. floor - Pixel values are rounded down to the nearest quantization step. round - Pixel values are rounded to the nearest quantization step.\n\n  vstep - The quantization step size for pixel values.\n\n\n\n  voffset - An offset for the quantization step so that it doesn't have to lie on zero.\n\n\n\n  quantpos -  - The function used for spacial quantization e.g. quantizing the UV coordinates so that pixel values are merged into larger blocks.\n\n off - Position (spacial) quantization is not used. ceiling - Pixels are rounded up to the nearest spacial quantization step (towards the top-right). floor - Pixels are rounded down to the nearest spacial quantization step (towards the bottom-left). round - Pixels are rounded towards the nearest quantization step.\n\n  posstep - The size of the spacial quantization step in UV space (0-1)\n\n\n\n  posoffset - An offset applied to the spacial quantization so that the steps do not have to start at 0,0 (measured in 0-1 UV space).\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

This is required since these need to be the first lines in the shader, and TouchDesigner will be adding code to the start of your shader to declare uniforms/functions which would appear before #extension directives located in the main shader. #include statements should be avoided unless include-guards are in the DATs. This should not be used for pre-prending common code to your shaders. Use #include statements in the main shader to do that.\n\n\n\n  vertexdat - Points to the DAT holding the  .

Note that the shader compiler will likely not expose uniforms that are unused.\n\n\n\n  autodispatchsize - Automatically set the dispatch size based on the compute shader's local size and the output texture resolution. Ensures at least one thread per pixel will execute.\n\n\n\n  dispatchsize -  - The dispatch size to use when executing a compute shader.\n\n dispatchsizex - dispatchsizey - dispatchsizez -\n\n  outputaccess -  - Controls how the output textures will be accessed. If the textures will be read from (such as using previous frame's values), then the access should be changed to Read-Write instead of Write Only.\n\n writeonly - readonly - readwrite -\n\n  type -  - Specify what type of texture to create. When creating  a 3D texture the  will render once for every slice of the output. Refer to  3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays for more info.\n\n texture2d - Creates a 2D texture. texture2darray - Creates a 2D Texture Array. Slices of the array can be access using a non-normalized integer index for the w coordinate. texture3d - Creates a 3D Texture. Slices of the array can be accessed using the w coordinate in the range 0-1. Value of the texture in between slices are interpolated.\n\n  depth -  - Set the depth of the 3D texture from the Input or the Custom Depth parameter.\n\n input - custom -\n\n  customdepth - Manually set the depth of the 3D texture, otherwise it will use the depth of the input.\n\n\n\n  clearoutputs - When using a Compute , this controls if the output texture should be cleared at the start of each cook. Otherwise the data from the previous cook will stay in the texture, and pixels can be left as-is in the Compute .\n\n\n\n  clearvalue -  - The color value to clear all pixels to at the start of the cook.\n\n clearvaluer - clearvalueg - clearvalueb - clearvaluea -\n\n  inputmapping -  - Determines how the node's input(s) are passed into the shader for use when creating a 3D Texture. By default all of the inputs are passed to each slice. When using the N inputs per Slice mode, the first N inputs are passed to the first slice, the next N inputs are passed the second slice, and so on. When it runs out of inputs it loops back to the first input. N is selected by the parameter N Value.\n\n all - ninputs -\n\n  nval - Determines how many inputs are passed to the shader per slice when using the N inputs per Slice mode for Input Mapping. If for example this is set to 2, then the first 2 inputs will be passed to the first slice, the next 2 inputs will be passed the second slice, and so on. It will loop back to the start of the inputs if it runs out before it reaches the last slice.\n\n\n\n  inputextenduv -  - Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the U and V texture coordinates (called S and T in the shader) are outside [0-1] range.\n\n hold - zero - repeat - mirror -\n\n  inputextendw -  - Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the W texture coordinate (called W in the shader) are outside [0-1] range. Only useful for 3D Texture.\n\n hold - zero - repeat - mirror -\n\n  numcolorbufs - Any shader you write can output to more than one RGBA buffer at a time. Turn up this value to have more color buffers allocated for you, and refer to [Write_a_GLSL_#Outputting_to_Multiple_Color_Buffers Write a GLSL ] for more information on using this feature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are passed as uniforms into your shader. Depending on how the uniform is declared only some of the values of the 4 available per parameter as passes to the shader. For example, if the uniform is declared as a vec2, then only the first 2 values are passed to the shader, the other 2 are ignored.\n\n  vec - Sequence of vector uniforms\n\n\n\n  vec0name - The uniform name, as declared in the shader\n\n\n\n  vec0value -  - The value(s) to give the uniform.\n\n vec0valuex - vec0valuey - vec0valuez - vec0valuew -\n\n\n\n\n Uniforms allow you to send  channel data into a GLSL shader as an array. Depending on the array type used, the number of values you can send into the shader may be limited. If you are using Uniform Arrays, you can use the Built-In variable int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS')) to get an idea of how many values you can pass to the shader. Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS')) / 4. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum. If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, int(var('SYS_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE')) will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.\n\n  array - Sequence of array uniforms\n\n\n\n  array0name - The name of the uniform. You can send up to 4 channels into the GLSL shader in a single uniform. The number of channels is determined by the float/vec2/vec3/vec4 menu to the right of the name. For a  with a single channel declare your uniform as a float, for one with two channels declare your uniform as a vec2, etc. The data is interleaved in the uniform. I.e the .x component is the 1st channel, .y is the 2nd channel, etc.\n\n\n\n  array0type -  - The data type of the uniform in the shader.\n\n float - vec2 - vec3 - vec4 -\n\n  array0chop - The channels from this  will be sent to the GLSL shader.\n\n\n\n  array0arraytype -  - The type of the uniform.\n\n uniformarray - All GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Uniform Arrays. texturebuffer - Newer GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Texture Buffers. Texture Buffers use texture memory and texture fetches to access the data, which allows them to store many more values.Declare them:\n\n\n\nAnd sample them like this\n\n\n\nWhere i is the 0-based index (an integer) into the buffer that you want to get a value for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  matrix - Sequence of matrix uniforms\n\n\n\n  matrix0name - The name of the matrix uniform.\n\n\n\n  matrix0value - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the Matrix Parameters article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ac - Sequence of atomic counter uniforms\n\n\n\n  ac0name - The name of the uniform.\n\n\n\n  ac0initvalue -  - Specifies how the atomic counters receive their initial value, either through a single default value or a .\n\n val - chop -\n\n  ac0singlevalue - Specifies a single value that all atomic counters in this binding will be initialized to.\n\n\n\n  ac0chopvalue - A reference to the  that will determine the initial values of the atomic counters in this binding. The  will be spanned in track order, so the values from the first track will be read in order first, then the next track (if there is one) and so on. If there are more initial values to fill than there are values in the  then they will all be set to 0. Atomic counters will be initialized from low to high offsets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialization Constants can optionally have their values assigned here.\n\n  const - Sequence of constant uniforms\n\n\n\n  const0name - The constant name, as declared in the shader.\n\n\n\n  const0value - The value to give the constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1.

Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS')) / 4. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum. If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, int(var('SYS_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE')) will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.\n\n  array - Sequence of array uniforms\n\n\n\n  array0name - The name of the uniform. You can send up to 4 channels into the GLSL shader in a single uniform. The number of channels is determined by the float/vec2/vec3/vec4 menu to the right of the name.

Atomic counters will be initialized from low to high offsets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialization Constants can optionally have their values assigned here.\n\n  const - Sequence of constant uniforms\n\n\n\n  const0name - The constant name, as declared in the shader.\n\n\n\n  const0value - The value to give the constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\n -\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the GLSL  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-revertedmw-manual-revert2022.241402021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe OpenGL (pre-2022) or Vulkan (2022-) code that runs on the GPU and creates rendered images from polygons and textures.

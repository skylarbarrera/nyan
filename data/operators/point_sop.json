The   also lets you create custom point attributes. It is the complement to the Primitive SOP. Using a second input allows for combining of two SOPs using their respective expressions (see: PointSOP Class). If the second input has less points than the first input, the points in the second input will be cycled.\t\t\nFor example, you can create point coloring, or flip the normals of incoming geometry. Using expressions in Position X, Y and Z, you can move any given input point to a new place as defined by the expression with any standard attributes. \t\t\nThe Width (width) attribute affects the line width in the Line MAT.

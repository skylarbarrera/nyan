Multiple devices can simultaneously stream video into TouchDesigner by using multiple Device In TOPs. HD-SDI video can be streamed into TouchDesigner through capture cards such and those from Blackmagic Design, AJA and Deltacast.\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIf the device does not seem to provide a video stream but it is visible in the  parameter menu, make sure no other applications are currently using the device.\t\nTIP: Create an Info DAT and point it to the Video Device In  to see what devices are currently attached. The Info CHOP gives data for analyzing the performance of Video Device In and Out TOPs. Additionally, the Info CHOP can be used to obtain timecode embeded into the source signal on some device, as indicated in the below list.\nMajor capture devices vendors currently supported:\n\nBlackmagic Design\t- Supports Timecode.\nAJA - Supports Timecode.\nDeltacast\t- Supports Timecode.\nBluefish444AJA and Blackmagic Design devices now support 12-bit input and output formats, including AJA’s ability to capture at a full 12-bit RGB 4:4:4. Furthermore, 10-bit input and output have received performance improvements and better support for a wider selection of firmware.\nAlso supported with native drivers are some models from Datapath SDI, Allied Vision, Imaging Development Systems (IDS), FLIR/ Grey, and Ximea.\t\t\t\t\t\nFor Magewell HDMI-to-USB3 capture (highly recommended, no drivers, plug-and-play), see Magewell.\nIP Cameras include models from Allied Vision (PvAPI SDK models only, not Vimba SDK), Point Grey FLIR Flycapture2 and Spinnaker and Imaging Development Systems (IDS). In case of IDS's Cameras, TouchDesigner implements the uEye IDS Software Suite. GigE Vision cameras are currently not supported.\nUSB3 Cameras include models from Allied Vision (PvAPI SDK models only, not Vimba SDK), Point Grey FLIR Flycapture2 and Spinnaker and Imaging Development Systems (IDS)\nOnly a small subset of cameras from each manufacturer has been tested in-house, however it's expected that any modern camera from the supported manufacturer should work. If any issues are encountered please contact support@derivative.ca.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSee also Video Device Out TOP.\nvideodeviceinTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - When set to one the  captures the image stream from the camera or decoder.\n\n\n\n  driver -  - Selects the library to use to interface with the cameras.\n\n directshow - mediafoundation - imagingsource - datapath - blackmagic - alliedvisiongige - ids - pointgreyflycapture - flirspinnaker - avfoundation - bluefish444 - aja - ximea - deltacast -\n\n  device -  - Select which camera or decoder you want from this menu.\n\n V1 -\n\n  specifyip - When using Allied Vision library allows you to specify the camera address by IP.\n\n\n\n  ip - The IP address used when Specify IP above is turned on.\n\n\n\n  options - Opens the options or control panel for the camera. NOTE: Only works when using DirectShow (WDM) cameras.\n\n\n\n  deinterlace -  - Sets which fields to capture.\n\n off - Captures all fields. even - Capture Even fields only. odd - Captures Odd fields only. bob - Alternatively shows the even then odd fields, resulting in twice the framerate being shown, and removing the interlacing artifacts.\n\n  precedence -  - When using Bob (Split) deinterlacing, this selects which field is shown first for each frame.\n\n even - odd -\n\n  channel - Selects the TV channel if a TV tuner is used as the video input.\n\n\n\n  signalformat - The signal format to capture input at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.\n\n\n\n  quadlink - Used for cards that support quad-link formats. Quad-link esstenially takes 4 inputs and creates one single larger input out of them, for example 4 1080p inputs become a single 4K input.\n\n\n\n  inputpixelformat -  - Some capture devices support pixel formats other than 8-bit. For supported devices (Blackmagic Design) this will make the node attempt to use that capability.\n\n fixed8 - 8-bit per channel precision. fixed10 - 10-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGB10A2. fixed16 - 16-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGBA16-Fixed. fixed12 -\n\n  transfermode -  - Controls how the frames are transferred from the input device to CPU memory, and how they are transferred from CPU memory to the .\n\n automatic - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. In general this will be 'Pre-Upload'. preupload - Upload the frames to the  as they arrived. This ensures the data is already in  memory when the  wants to process it. ondemand - Only upload frames to the  if the  is going to display them for that cook. This reduces PCIe bandwidth between the  and CPU memory in cases where the  is showing less frames than what the input device is capturing. However this means the  may stall waiting for that frame to be uploaded. ondemandsync - This mode is currently only available for AJA devices. This causes the whole TouchDesigner process to stall until right after a frame arrives on this input. Then the process will start executing and use that input frame for this nodes cook. This removes any latency from the capture input, but can result in worse performance. Real-time should turned off for the TouchDesigner process at the top of the UI, and only one node should be set to this mode in a single process.\n\n  memorymode -  - Controls the memory type used to transfer data between the capture card and the .\n\n automatic - Will choose the best memory mode for the transfer. This will be 'Pinned' for capture cards that support it, and 'Regular' if not. pinned - Pinned memory allows data to be transferred in 2 copies instead of three. Capture->Pinned CPU Memory, Pinned CPU Memory-> Memory. regular - The regular memory mode means 3 copies are required. Capture->Capture Writable Memory, Capture Writable Memory-> Readable Memory,  Readable Memory-> Memory.\n\n  syncinputs - Enabling syncing of multiple Video Device In TOPs. Syncing allows multiple nodes using multiple inputs and capture cards on a single system to ensure they are outputting frames in sync. Without this each node will be free running and will possible be outputting frames that came it at different times due to internal queuing. It's important the input sources are GenLocked to ensure all of their data arrives to all of the inputs at the same time, otherwise syncing will not work. This feature is currently supported for Blackmagic, DataPath, Deltacast and BlueFish devices.\n\n\n\n  syncgroupindex - There can be multiple sync groups active in a  file. Nodes will only sync to other nodes that are part of the same sync group.\n\n\n\n  maxsyncoffset - Specified in milliseconds. The maximum difference in time two image could have arrived at be considered in-sync. Images that arrive at times more different than this offset will be considered to be part of different 'frame'.\n\n\n\n  synctimeout - How much time to wait for all frames in a sync group to become available before giving up trying to sync. Expressed in milliseconds. If this timeout elapses when waiting for a frame from one or more sources in the sync group, all of the nodes in the sync group will keep their current image and not output a new image, even if some new images arrived on some of the inputs.\n\n\n\n  resetstats - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently all of these options are only available for Ximea cameras.\n\n  preset -  - \n\n externallyconfigured - custom -\n\n  autoge - \n\n\n\n  autogebias - \n\n\n\n  autogelevel - \n\n\n\n  maxgain - \n\n\n\n  maxexposure - \n\n\n\n  gain - \n\n\n\n  exposure - \n\n\n\n  cgamma - \n\n\n\n  lgamma - \n\n\n\n  limitfps - \n\n\n\n  limitedfps - \n\n\n\n  capture - \n\n\n\n  capturepulse - \n\n\n\n  autowb - \n\n\n\n  wbcoeffs -  - \n\n wbcoeffsr - wbcoeffsg - wbcoeffsb -\n\n  custombandwidth -  - \n\n default - on - off -\n\n  bandwidthlimit - \n\n\n\n  camerabitdepth -  - \n\n automatic - 8bit - 10bit - 12bit -\n\n  gpudemosaic - \n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Video Device In  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - 1 if the node is successfully connected to the device, 0 if not. This does not necessarily mean there is valid input coming to the device.\n - When using the 'Sync Group' feature, this counts how many times the group failed to all provide a frame with similar enough timestamps within the timeout period.\n - How long the node had to wait from the time it was ready for a new frame until all the inputs provided valid frames for a synced output.\n - When de-interlacing an interlaced input, this will be 1 when the odd field is being shown and 0 when the even field is being shown.\n - The calculated number of frames per second that are being captured by the device. This does not map directly to the signal format rate. It won't show 59.97 for example. This is simply a count of how many frames were captured in the last 1000ms.\n - The total number of frames that have been captured this capture began.\n - How many times the node has shown the same frame more than once. It does not currently correct for if the repeats are expected, such as when capturing a 30hz signal but TouchDesigner is running at 60fps. In that case the channel will keep increasing since each captured frame will be shown twice.\n - This counts how many frames were captured by the card, but never consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thrad. This occurs if the capture is running faster than TouchDesigner is able to consume frames.\n - This counts how many frames were consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thread, but never consumed by the node itself. This can occur if TouchDesigner isn't running at full frame rate.\n - Counts connection changes, not supported by all devices.\n - On supported devices, outputs the temperature of the device in celsius. Will be a very negative number for devices that don't support it.\n - The actual signal format  of the input signal. 0 if unknown.\n - Will be 1 if the input is detected as an RGB (such as RGB 4:4:4 colorspace) format. 0 if it is a YUV based colorspace. -1 if it is unknown or not supported by the the library.\n - The number of receieved frames queued inside TouchDesigner.\n - The number of frames still queued on the device that TouchDesigner has not yet read.\n - The number of milliseconds it took to copy the last frame from the device to the CPU. -1 if this is not measured.\n - Time in seconds of the last frame displayed. -1 if this is not provided by the device.\n - Horizontal resolution of the  in pixels. - Vertical resolution of the  in pixels. - Horizontal aspect of the . - Vertical aspect of the . - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this  contains a 2D or 3D texture array. - Total amount of texture memory used by this .\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditorwikieditormw-rollback2022.241402021.100002020.200002018.28070before 2018.28070\nTOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.

NOTE: Only works when using DirectShow (WDM) cameras.\n\n\n\n  deinterlace -  - Sets which fields to capture.\n\n off - Captures all fields. even - Capture Even fields only. odd - Captures Odd fields only. bob - Alternatively shows the even then odd fields, resulting in twice the framerate being shown, and removing the interlacing artifacts.\n\n  precedence -  - When using Bob (Split) deinterlacing, this selects which field is shown first for each frame.\n\n even - odd -\n\n  channel - Selects the TV channel if a TV tuner is used as the video input.\n\n\n\n  signalformat - The signal format to capture input at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.\n\n\n\n  quadlink - Used for cards that support quad-link formats. Quad-link esstenially takes 4 inputs and creates one single larger input out of them, for example 4 1080p inputs become a single 4K input.\n\n\n\n  inputpixelformat -  - Some capture devices support pixel formats other than 8-bit. For supported devices (Blackmagic Design) this will make the node attempt to use that capability.\n\n fixed8 - 8-bit per channel precision. fixed10 - 10-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGB10A2. fixed16 - 16-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGBA16-Fixed. fixed12 -\n\n  transfermode -  - Controls how the frames are transferred from the input device to CPU memory, and how they are transferred from CPU memory to the .\n\n automatic - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. In general this will be 'Pre-Upload'. preupload - Upload the frames to the  as they arrived. This ensures the data is already in  memory when the  wants to process it. ondemand - Only upload frames to the  if the  is going to display them for that cook. This reduces PCIe bandwidth between the  and CPU memory in cases where the  is showing less frames than what the input device is capturing. However this means the  may stall waiting for that frame to be uploaded. ondemandsync - This mode is currently only available for AJA devices. This causes the whole TouchDesigner process to stall until right after a frame arrives on this input. Then the process will start executing and use that input frame for this nodes cook. This removes any latency from the capture input, but can result in worse performance. Real-time should turned off for the TouchDesigner process at the top of the UI, and only one node should be set to this mode in a single process.\n\n  memorymode -  - Controls the memory type used to transfer data between the capture card and the .\n\n automatic - Will choose the best memory mode for the transfer. This will be 'Pinned' for capture cards that support it, and 'Regular' if not. pinned - Pinned memory allows data to be transferred in 2 copies instead of three. Capture->Pinned CPU Memory, Pinned CPU Memory-> Memory. regular - The regular memory mode means 3 copies are required. Capture->Capture Writable Memory, Capture Writable Memory-> Readable Memory,  Readable Memory-> Memory.\n\n  syncinputs - Enabling syncing of multiple Video Device In TOPs. Syncing allows multiple nodes using multiple inputs and capture cards on a single system to ensure they are outputting frames in sync. Without this each node will be free running and will possible be outputting frames that came it at different times due to internal queuing. It's important the input sources are GenLocked to ensure all of their data arrives to all of the inputs at the same time, otherwise syncing will not work. This feature is currently supported for Blackmagic, DataPath, Deltacast and BlueFish devices.\n\n\n\n  syncgroupindex - There can be multiple sync groups active in a  file. Nodes will only sync to other nodes that are part of the same sync group.\n\n\n\n  maxsyncoffset - Specified in milliseconds. The maximum difference in time two image could have arrived at be considered in-sync. Images that arrive at times more different than this offset will be considered to be part of different 'frame'.\n\n\n\n  synctimeout - How much time to wait for all frames in a sync group to become available before giving up trying to sync. Expressed in milliseconds. If this timeout elapses when waiting for a frame from one or more sources in the sync group, all of the nodes in the sync group will keep their current image and not output a new image, even if some new images arrived on some of the inputs.\n\n\n\n  resetstats - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently all of these options are only available for Ximea cameras.\n\n  preset -  - \n\n externallyconfigured - custom -\n\n  autoge - \n\n\n\n  autogebias - \n\n\n\n  autogelevel - \n\n\n\n  maxgain - \n\n\n\n  maxexposure - \n\n\n\n  gain - \n\n\n\n  exposure - \n\n\n\n  cgamma - \n\n\n\n  lgamma - \n\n\n\n  limitfps - \n\n\n\n  limitedfps - \n\n\n\n  capture - \n\n\n\n  capturepulse - \n\n\n\n  autowb - \n\n\n\n  wbcoeffs -  - \n\n wbcoeffsr - wbcoeffsg - wbcoeffsb -\n\n  custombandwidth -  - \n\n default - on - off -\n\n  bandwidthlimit - \n\n\n\n  camerabitdepth -  - \n\n automatic - 8bit - 10bit - 12bit -\n\n  gpudemosaic - \n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Video Device In  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - 1 if the node is successfully connected to the device, 0 if not. This does not necessarily mean there is valid input coming to the device.\n - When using the 'Sync Group' feature, this counts how many times the group failed to all provide a frame with similar enough timestamps within the timeout period.\n - How long the node had to wait from the time it was ready for a new frame until all the inputs provided valid frames for a synced output.\n - When de-interlacing an interlaced input, this will be 1 when the odd field is being shown and 0 when the even field is being shown.\n - The calculated number of frames per second that are being captured by the device. This does not map directly to the signal format rate. It won't show 59.97 for example. This is simply a count of how many frames were captured in the last 1000ms.\n - The total number of frames that have been captured this capture began.\n - How many times the node has shown the same frame more than once. It does not currently correct for if the repeats are expected, such as when capturing a 30hz signal but TouchDesigner is running at 60fps. In that case the channel will keep increasing since each captured frame will be shown twice.\n - This counts how many frames were captured by the card, but never consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thrad. This occurs if the capture is running faster than TouchDesigner is able to consume frames.\n - This counts how many frames were consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thread, but never consumed by the node itself.

This will be 'Pinned' for capture cards that support it, and 'Regular' if not. pinned - Pinned memory allows data to be transferred in 2 copies instead of three. Capture->Pinned CPU Memory, Pinned CPU Memory-> Memory. regular - The regular memory mode means 3 copies are required. Capture->Capture Writable Memory, Capture Writable Memory-> Readable Memory,  Readable Memory-> Memory.\n\n  syncinputs - Enabling syncing of multiple Video Device In TOPs. Syncing allows multiple nodes using multiple inputs and capture cards on a single system to ensure they are outputting frames in sync. Without this each node will be free running and will possible be outputting frames that came it at different times due to internal queuing. It's important the input sources are GenLocked to ensure all of their data arrives to all of the inputs at the same time, otherwise syncing will not work. This feature is currently supported for Blackmagic, DataPath, Deltacast and BlueFish devices.\n\n\n\n  syncgroupindex - There can be multiple sync groups active in a  file. Nodes will only sync to other nodes that are part of the same sync group.\n\n\n\n  maxsyncoffset - Specified in milliseconds. The maximum difference in time two image could have arrived at be considered in-sync. Images that arrive at times more different than this offset will be considered to be part of different 'frame'.\n\n\n\n  synctimeout - How much time to wait for all frames in a sync group to become available before giving up trying to sync. Expressed in milliseconds. If this timeout elapses when waiting for a frame from one or more sources in the sync group, all of the nodes in the sync group will keep their current image and not output a new image, even if some new images arrived on some of the inputs.\n\n\n\n  resetstats - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently all of these options are only available for Ximea cameras.\n\n  preset -  - \n\n externallyconfigured - custom -\n\n  autoge - \n\n\n\n  autogebias - \n\n\n\n  autogelevel - \n\n\n\n  maxgain - \n\n\n\n  maxexposure - \n\n\n\n  gain - \n\n\n\n  exposure - \n\n\n\n  cgamma - \n\n\n\n  lgamma - \n\n\n\n  limitfps - \n\n\n\n  limitedfps - \n\n\n\n  capture - \n\n\n\n  capturepulse - \n\n\n\n  autowb - \n\n\n\n  wbcoeffs -  - \n\n wbcoeffsr - wbcoeffsg - wbcoeffsb -\n\n  custombandwidth -  - \n\n default - on - off -\n\n  bandwidthlimit - \n\n\n\n  camerabitdepth -  - \n\n automatic - 8bit - 10bit - 12bit -\n\n  gpudemosaic - \n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite). rgb16float - rgb32float - mono8fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel. mono16fixed - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono16float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 16-bits per pixel. mono32float - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 32-bits per pixel. rg8fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits total per pixel. rg16fixed - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg16float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits total per pixel. rg32float - A 2 channel format, R and G have values, while B is 0 always and Alpha is 1.0. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits total per pixel. a8fixed - An Alpha only format that has 8-bits per channel, 8-bits per pixel. a16fixed - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a16float - An Alpha only format that has 16-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. a32float - An Alpha only format that has 32-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha8fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 8-bits per channel, 16-bits per pixel. monoalpha16fixed - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha16float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 16-bits per channel, 32-bits per pixel. monoalpha32float - A 2 channel format, one value for RGB and one value for Alpha. 32-bits per channel, 64-bits per pixel.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Video Device In  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n - 1 if the node is successfully connected to the device, 0 if not. This does not necessarily mean there is valid input coming to the device.\n - When using the 'Sync Group' feature, this counts how many times the group failed to all provide a frame with similar enough timestamps within the timeout period.\n - How long the node had to wait from the time it was ready for a new frame until all the inputs provided valid frames for a synced output.\n - When de-interlacing an interlaced input, this will be 1 when the odd field is being shown and 0 when the even field is being shown.\n - The calculated number of frames per second that are being captured by the device. This does not map directly to the signal format rate. It won't show 59.97 for example. This is simply a count of how many frames were captured in the last 1000ms.\n - The total number of frames that have been captured this capture began.\n - How many times the node has shown the same frame more than once. It does not currently correct for if the repeats are expected, such as when capturing a 30hz signal but TouchDesigner is running at 60fps. In that case the channel will keep increasing since each captured frame will be shown twice.\n - This counts how many frames were captured by the card, but never consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thrad. This occurs if the capture is running faster than TouchDesigner is able to consume frames.\n - This counts how many frames were consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thread, but never consumed by the node itself. This can occur if TouchDesigner isn't running at full frame rate.\n - Counts connection changes, not supported by all devices.\n - On supported devices, outputs the temperature of the device in celsius.

The NDI® protocol is created by Newtek.\nAttach an Audio NDI CHOP to the NDI In  to extract audio from the NDI stream. \nMetadata can also be sent to the NDI In  from an NDI Out TOP or another system that has attached metadata to the NDI stream. Attach an Info DAT to the NDI In  to get the metadata as text. It is in an XML format. To better see and access the XML, attach an XML DAT to the Info . \nBut you can also send a table-format  in the NDI Out TOP and it will be received in the Info  as a table.  \nTo send metadata in an NDI stream, see the NDI Out 's Metadata  parameter.\nTo see details of the available NDI streams, use the NDI DAT.\nSee also NDI, NDI Out TOP and NDI DAT.\nNOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues, check Windows firewall settings.\nndiinTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Receives image data while Active is on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  name - Select which source stream to use.\n\n\n\t\t\n  extraips - By default NDI searches using mDNS, which is usually limited to locate networks. To find sources available on machines not reachable by mDNS, this parameter can be filled with a space-separated list of one or more IP address.\n\n\n\t\t\n  bandwidth -  - Choose High or Low bandwidth option.\n\n high - low -\n\n  hwdecode - Enable hardware decode for NDI|HX encoded video streams. Hardware decoding is not supported for native NDI codec, only NDI|HX (which is H264). The NDI Out TOP and other software based NDI solutions can only send native NDI, not NDI|HX. Currently only some hardware capture devices support streaming NDI|HX.\n\n\n\n  inputpixelformat -  - Choose Native or 8-bit pixel format.\n\n native - fixed8 -\n\n  grouptable - Sources can tag themselves as part of one or more 'Groups'. Fill in rows of this table with the names of one or more groups this node is interested in to limited the 'Sources' listed as available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  audiobuflen - The length of the audio buffer in seconds.

Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images.

When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

      "description": "The NDI In  will obtain its image data over IP from other DI® (Network Data Interface) enabled applications. The NDI® protocol is created by Newtek.\nAttach an Audio NDI CHOP to the NDI In  to extract audio from the NDI stream. \nMetadata can also be sent to the NDI In  from an NDI Out TOP or another system that has attached metadata to the NDI stream. Attach an Info DAT to the NDI In  to get the metadata as text. It is in an XML format. To better see and access the XML, attach an XML DAT to the Info . \nBut you can also send a table-format  in the NDI Out TOP and it will be received in the Info  as a table.  \nTo send metadata in an NDI stream, see the NDI Out 's Metadata  parameter.\nTo see details of the available NDI streams, use the NDI DAT.\nSee also NDI, NDI Out TOP and NDI DAT.\nNOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues, check Windows firewall settings.\nndiinTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  active - Receives image data while Active is on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  name - Select which source stream to use.\n\n\n\t\t\n  extraips - By default NDI searches using mDNS, which is usually limited to locate networks. To find sources available on machines not reachable by mDNS, this parameter can be filled with a space-separated list of one or more IP address.\n\n\n\t\t\n  bandwidth -  - Choose High or Low bandwidth option.\n\n high - low -\n\n  hwdecode - Enable hardware decode for NDI|HX encoded video streams. Hardware decoding is not supported for native NDI codec, only NDI|HX (which is H264). The NDI Out TOP and other software based NDI solutions can only send native NDI, not NDI|HX. Currently only some hardware capture devices support streaming NDI|HX.\n\n\n\n  inputpixelformat -  - Choose Native or 8-bit pixel format.\n\n native - fixed8 -\n\n  grouptable - Sources can tag themselves as part of one or more 'Groups'. Fill in rows of this table with the names of one or more groups this node is interested in to limited the 'Sources' listed as available.\n\n\n\t\t\n  audiobuflen - The length of the audio buffer in seconds. Audio output is delayed by this amount. For example, if the Buffer Length is 0.1 then the sound will occur 100ms = 0.1 seconds later than received (to keep the buffer full).\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. limit - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same. custom - Directly control the width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected 's image.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1.

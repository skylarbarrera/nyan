More generally, you give it a rate (the  input) and it outputs a cumulative value. For example, the Speed  converts rotation rate (rotations per second) into the number of rotation turns. ( Math-heads recognize this as an 'integral', which calculates the area under a curve. The curve is the incoming channel values over a time range, the output is the area.)\t\t\nIf you send a Constant  channel that has value 1 into the Speed , then the Speed  output will increase by 1 every second. If you feed it -2, it will decrease by 2 every second, and if you feed it 0, the output will not change. Use a Trail  to see its results. You can reset the Speed  to 0 by pressing the Reset parameter, or by sending in a channel (whose value is greater than 0) into the second input.\t\t\t\nThe first input contains the channels to be 'integrated'. By default, the Speed  is time-sliced, so it keeps adding/subtracting to the output each frame it cooks. If you turn off its  parameter and send it a  with a fixed frame range (like a default Noise ), you can see the cumulative value starting from 0.\t\t\t\nThe output is calculated by adding the input's channel values for every sample, divided by the samples per second of the Speed  (typically 60), starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative input values reduce the output, positive values increase it. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.\t\t\t\nWhen the  is reset, its output can be set to any value via the  parameter.\t\t\t\nWhen the second input is used to reset the output, where the second input is greater than 0, the area is reset and held to the reset value. For example, a Wave CHOP (which is negative half the time) when passed into the second input causes the output to be reset for half a cycle.\t\t\t\nSee also: Lookup CHOP, Timer CHOP, Count CHOP, Event CHOP\nspeedCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  order -  - Determines the order of the integral to use.

The cumulative values are put in the output channels.\t\t\t\nWhen the  is reset, its output can be set to any value via the  parameter.\t\t\t\nWhen the second input is used to reset the output, where the second input is greater than 0, the area is reset and held to the reset value. For example, a Wave CHOP (which is negative half the time) when passed into the second input causes the output to be reset for half a cycle.\t\t\t\nSee also: Lookup CHOP, Timer CHOP, Count CHOP, Event CHOP\nspeedCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  order -  - Determines the order of the integral to use. If the input is a velocity, a First Order integral will return the position. If the input is an acceleration, a Second Order integral will return the position, and a First Order integral will return the velocity.\n\n first - second - third -\n\t\t\n  constant1 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating once.\n\n\n\t\t\n  constant2 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating twice.\n\n\n\t\t\n  constant3 - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating three times.\n\n\n\t\t\n  limittype -  - Select limit options such as loop, clamp, or zigzag from the menu. The value will remain in the range from Min to less than Max.\n\n off - Do not limit the values. clamp - Simply cut the channel value off if it is out of the Maximum/Minimum range, and replace it with the Maximum or Minimum limit value. loop - Continue the channel at the other end of the interval. zigzag - Mirror the values back inside the interval.\n\t\t\n  min - The minimum value the output channel can have.\n\n\n\t\t\n  max - The maximum value the output channel can have.\n\n\n\n  speedsamples - Applies the speed to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.\n\n\n\n  resetcondition -  - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).\n\n offtoon - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on. on - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off. ontooff - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off. off - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.\n\t\t\n  resetvalue - The channel(s) is set to this value when reset.\n\n\n\t\t\n  reset - While On, this toggle resets the channel(s) to the .\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetpulse - Click to instantly resets the channel(s) to the .\n\n\n\t\t\n  resetonstart - While On, the Speed  will reset each time the  file is restarted. If the Speed 's value gets too large it can start stepping as when it reaches the limit of 's number resolution. This is useful for projects that run for a long time, restarting the file will reset this value.\n\n\n\n\n\n  timeslice - Turning this on forces the channels to be \"Time Sliced\".  A  is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\n  scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a  string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.\n\n\n\n  srselect -  - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or \"Linear\" if the Interpolate Options are not available.\n\n first - Use rate of first input to resample others. max - Resample to the highest sample rate. min - Resample to the lowest sample rate. err - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.\n\n  exportmethod -  - This will determine how to connect the  channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.\n\n datindex - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the . datname - Uses the docked  table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the . autoname - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has geo1/transform1:tx.\n\n  autoexportroot - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is : are relative to.\n\n\n\n  exporttable - The  used to hold the export information when using the  Table  Methods (See above).\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n -\n\nExtra Information for the Speed  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Start of the  interval in samples. - Number of samples in the . - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second. - Number of channels in the . - 1 if  is  enabled, 0 otherwise. - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\n2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCHOPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nA parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.\n\n\n\nsamples-per-second of a CHOP. Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a Frame Rate, which is the number of frames to cook and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nEvery operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator paths, which determine the output of the operator.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. \"root\" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The Network Path or Path for root is simply /. A typical path is /project1/moviein1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Speed_CHOP&oldid=27594\"",

Unlike Clone, it automatically creates copies of a master component.\nIt creates replicant nodes (\"replicants\") and deletes them as the table changes or the replicant count changes. The replicant master can be a full component and its contents or a single node. \t\t\nIt takes the node specified in the  parameter, and makes a copy of the master for every row in the  (or specified by the Number of Replicant parameter).\t\nThe nodes that are created can be named in two ways. Copies can be named/numbered sequentially using\t\t\t\nthe prefix specified by the  parameter: item1, item2, ... Alternately, copies can be named based on the string in a column of the table, specified with the  parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you want to create a node for the first row of the table, un-set the  parameter.\t\t\t\nThe replicants get laid out in a grid in the network, determined by the  and  parameters.\t\t\t\nThe  does not assume or require that the master and replicants are components – they can all be Movie File In TOPs if you want. It also does not assume or require that the replicants are Clones.  However the  can be a component whose Clone parameter is set to itself, so that all nodes created are clones of the master.\t\t\t\nFor every replicant, you can run a script in the callback  where you can see some examples of typical cases that you can adapt. Here are some others:\t\t\t\n\nchange the expression of a parameter: c.par.display.expr = \"op('thing')[op.digits, 'display']\"\nChange the parameter expression mode:  c.par.display.mode = ParMode.EXPRESSION    The mode is one of: ParMode.CONSTANT, ParMode.EXPRESSION, or ParMode.EXPORT.If only one line of a table changes, the other existing replicants are not changed or re-created. In the callback , removing onRemoveReplicant() will keep the replicants around to be re-used when the table grows again.\t\t\t\nThis is an extremely powerful node type. Examples: (1) A button gadget for each row of the table. a geometry component, which is replicated at every point of a 3D particle system, each behaving separately. (2) You can feed the table of a Multi Touch In DAT directly to the  to create something at each fingertip.\nreplicatorCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  method -  - Choose between using a Template  Table where each row will create a replicant or using the Number of Replicants parameter below to set how many replications to make.\n\n bynum - bytable -\n\t\t\n  numreplicants - Set number of replicants when using Replication Method = By Number above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  template -  to the table  that will drive the replicating.\n\n\n\t\t\n  namefromtable -  - How the node names will be generated.\n\n rowindex - Uses the Node Prefix parameter followed by the row number. The default creates nodes named item1, item2, item3 .... (The top row is 0). colbyindex - The node name is in the column specified by a column number. colbyname - The node name is in a column specified by a column name in the first row.\n\t\t\n  ignorefirstrow - Do not create a node for the first row.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colname - Name at the top of the column.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colindex - Column number, starting from 0.\n\n\n\t\t\n  opprefix - Add this prefix to all nodes.\n\n\n\t\t\n  master - Which node or component to replicate.\n\n\n\t\t\n  destination - Where to put the replicant nodes. If the location is .., it puts the nodes inside the parent, which is actually alongside the  component. If you put ., it will put it inside itself, that is, inside the  component.  If left blank, it will error.\n\n\n\t\t\n  domaxops - Enable the parameter below to set a maximum number of allowed replicants.\n\n\n\t\t\n  maxops - Max number of nodes replicated.\n\n\n\t\t\n  tscript -  only (use callback  in python): For every replicant, you can run a script to customize it relative to the master, such as setting the Display or  parameters, or a Render flag.  runs the script command to customize each replicant versus the master. me.curItem can be used here to access the current item and make changes to it.  Select one of the 3 entries in the drop menu to the right for some examples.\t\nIf you are using Tscript, some local variables are defined:\n\n$ITEM Name of current node being replicated.\n$MASTER Name of master node.\n$LOCATION Name of the location component.The most common need is for the master to not display, and the replicants to display. For Panel components it is most commonly \"opparm $ITEM paneldisplay ( 1 )\", and for Geometry components it is most commonly \"opset -d on $ITEM\".  Use the popup menu for some common scripts.\n\n\n\t\t\n  scriptmenu - Select from some commonly used scripts () in this menu.\n\n\n\t\t\n  callbacks -  to a  containing callbacks for each event received.  See replicatorCOMP_Class for usage.\n\n\n\t\t\n  layout -  - How to lay out the new nodes - all in one place (Off), horizontally, vertically, or in a grid.\n\n off - horizontal - vertical - grid -\n\t\t\n  layoutorigin -  - Where to lay out the new nodes, giving the XY location of the top-left node's bottom-left corner.\n\nlayoutorigin1 -layoutorigin2 -\n\t\t\n  doincremental - Enables the parameter below for incremental creation of replicants.\n\n\n\t\t\n  increment - Staggers the replication of operators to avoid large frame drops when creating replicants. It will create the specified number of replicants per frame at most, by default 1 per frame, if Incremental Update is on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  recreateall - Deletes all nodes it has created, then re-creates them using the template and its current parameters.\n\n\n\t\t\n  recreatemissing - Re-creates missing operators from the template table but does not delete and re-create already existing replicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the   can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nCreates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the \"for-loop\" of operators. Unlike Clone, it automatically creates copies of a master component.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThe generic thing that holds an Operator, and includes Flags (display, bypass, lock, render, immune) and its position/size in the network. Whether you \"lay down an Operator\" or \"lay down an Node\", you're doing the same thing.\n\n\n\n(1) The TouchDesigner window is made of a menu bar at the top, a Timeline at the bottom, plus one of a choice of Layouts in the middle. A Layout is made on one or more Panes, each Pane can contain a Network Editor, Viewer, Panel, etc. See Pane and Bookmark. (2) Nodes in a network are arranged using Layout commands in the RMB menu.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nA set of commands located in a Text DAT that are triggered to run under certain conditions. There are two scripting languages in TouchDesigner: Python and the original Tscript. Scripts and single-line commands can also be run in the Textport.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner's original built-in Command scripting language prior to Python.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Replicator_COMP&oldid=30723\"\n\t\tCategories: Touch GlossaryCOMPs",

      "description": "The   creates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the \"for-loop\" of operators. Unlike Clone, it automatically creates copies of a master component.\nIt creates replicant nodes (\"replicants\") and deletes them as the table changes or the replicant count changes. The replicant master can be a full component and its contents or a single node. \t\t\nIt takes the node specified in the  parameter, and makes a copy of the master for every row in the  (or specified by the Number of Replicant parameter).\t\nThe nodes that are created can be named in two ways. Copies can be named/numbered sequentially using\t\t\t\nthe prefix specified by the  parameter: item1, item2, ... Alternately, copies can be named based on the string in a column of the table, specified with the  parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you want to create a node for the first row of the table, un-set the  parameter.\t\t\t\nThe replicants get laid out in a grid in the network, determined by the  and  parameters.\t\t\t\nThe  does not assume or require that the master and replicants are components – they can all be Movie File In TOPs if you want. It also does not assume or require that the replicants are Clones.  However the  can be a component whose Clone parameter is set to itself, so that all nodes created are clones of the master.\t\t\t\nFor every replicant, you can run a script in the callback  where you can see some examples of typical cases that you can adapt. Here are some others:\t\t\t\n\nchange the expression of a parameter: c.par.display.expr = \"op('thing')[op.digits, 'display']\"\nChange the parameter expression mode:  c.par.display.mode = ParMode.EXPRESSION    The mode is one of: ParMode.CONSTANT, ParMode.EXPRESSION, or ParMode.EXPORT.If only one line of a table changes, the other existing replicants are not changed or re-created. In the callback , removing onRemoveReplicant() will keep the replicants around to be re-used when the table grows again.\t\t\t\nThis is an extremely powerful node type. Examples: (1) A button gadget for each row of the table. a geometry component, which is replicated at every point of a 3D particle system, each behaving separately. (2) You can feed the table of a Multi Touch In DAT directly to the  to create something at each fingertip.\nreplicatorCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  method -  - Choose between using a Template  Table where each row will create a replicant or using the Number of Replicants parameter below to set how many replications to make.\n\n bynum - bytable -\n\t\t\n  numreplicants - Set number of replicants when using Replication Method = By Number above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  template -  to the table  that will drive the replicating.\n\n\n\t\t\n  namefromtable -  - How the node names will be generated.\n\n rowindex - Uses the Node Prefix parameter followed by the row number. The default creates nodes named item1, item2, item3 .... (The top row is 0). colbyindex - The node name is in the column specified by a column number. colbyname - The node name is in a column specified by a column name in the first row.\n\t\t\n  ignorefirstrow - Do not create a node for the first row.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colname - Name at the top of the column.\n\n\n\t\t\n  colindex - Column number, starting from 0.\n\n\n\t\t\n  opprefix - Add this prefix to all nodes.\n\n\n\t\t\n  master - Which node or component to replicate.\n\n\n\t\t\n  destination - Where to put the replicant nodes. If the location is .., it puts the nodes inside the parent, which is actually alongside the  component. If you put ., it will put it inside itself, that is, inside the  component.  If left blank, it will error.\n\n\n\t\t\n  domaxops - Enable the parameter below to set a maximum number of allowed replicants.\n\n\n\t\t\n  maxops - Max number of nodes replicated.\n\n\n\t\t\n  tscript -  only (use callback  in python): For every replicant, you can run a script to customize it relative to the master, such as setting the Display or  parameters, or a Render flag.  runs the script command to customize each replicant versus the master. me.curItem can be used here to access the current item and make changes to it.  Select one of the 3 entries in the drop menu to the right for some examples.\t\nIf you are using Tscript, some local variables are defined:\n\n$ITEM Name of current node being replicated.\n$MASTER Name of master node.\n$LOCATION Name of the location component.The most common need is for the master to not display, and the replicants to display. For Panel components it is most commonly \"opparm $ITEM paneldisplay ( 1 )\", and for Geometry components it is most commonly \"opset -d on $ITEM\".  Use the popup menu for some common scripts.\n\n\n\t\t\n  scriptmenu - Select from some commonly used scripts () in this menu.\n\n\n\t\t\n  callbacks -  to a  containing callbacks for each event received.  See replicatorCOMP_Class for usage.\n\n\n\t\t\n  layout -  - How to lay out the new nodes - all in one place (Off), horizontally, vertically, or in a grid.\n\n off - horizontal - vertical - grid -\n\t\t\n  layoutorigin -  - Where to lay out the new nodes, giving the XY location of the top-left node's bottom-left corner.\n\nlayoutorigin1 -layoutorigin2 -\n\t\t\n  doincremental - Enables the parameter below for incremental creation of replicants.\n\n\n\t\t\n  increment - Staggers the replication of operators to avoid large frame drops when creating replicants. It will create the specified number of replicants per frame at most, by default 1 per frame, if Incremental Update is on.\n\n\n\t\t\n  recreateall - Deletes all nodes it has created, then re-creates them using the template and its current parameters.\n\n\n\t\t\n  recreatemissing - Re-creates missing operators from the template table but does not delete and re-create already existing replicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the   can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nCreates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the \"for-loop\" of operators.

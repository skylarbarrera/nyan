Parameters control how much of the bright spots of your input image get bloomed, how wide the bloom gets spread, and how it rolls off into the un-bloomed areas.\nThe bloom starts with a preprocessing stage (Pre-Black Level, Pre-Gamma, and Pre-Brightness), (similar to the Black Level, Brightness, and Gamma parameters of a Level TOP) which help to isolate the hot spots of the image that the bloom originates from (the Black Level), and boost the hot spots (Gamma and Brightness).  (Switch the Output menu for a moment to Pre-Process to make sure you have a good signal to bloom with.)\nThe second stage is a combination of scaled-down (blurred) levels of the pre-processed image: The first level is the original pre-processed image, the second level is scaled down to half size (essentially 4 pixels averaged into one pixel), the third is the second level scaled down to half, and so on until the \"top\" level is 1x1 pixel (the average of the whole image.) For example, a 1024 x 1024 input images gives 10 levels. (These are called mipmaps.)\nThe second stage blends a range of scaled-down blur levels using the Min Bloom Radius and Max Bloom Radius parameters, where 0 refers to the first scaled-down level and 1 refers to the top scaled-down level. The Min and Max determine how dispersed or smeared the blooming is. Note: If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.\nIn the third stage, the resulting bloom level is increased, reduced and shaped using Bloom Threshold, Bloom S-Curve, Bloom Fill and Bloom Intensity. Typically the Fill and Intensity parameters should be adjusted first, and then some adjustment with Threshold, Min and Max, and with more finesse, the S-Curve if necessary.\nTip: If you want to bloom something and composite it over something else or a variant of the original, set the Output parameter to Bloom with Alpha and add it (Add TOP) to something else.\nbloomTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  preblacklevel - Similar to the Black Level parameter of a Luma Level . Pixels with a luminosity less than this value are pushed to black.\n\n\n\n  pregamma - Similar to the Gamma parameter of a Luma Level , applies a gamma adjustment to the pixel value after the Pre-Black Level stage, which makes all non-zero values closer to RGB = 1, 1, 1.\n\n\n\n  prebrightness - Similar to the Brightness parameter of a Luma Level , it is a multiplier for the pixel value after the Pre-Gamma stage.\n\n\n\n  minbloomradius - Determines the minimum blur level to start sampling from. It is 0 to 1, so given a 1024x1024 image has 10 blur levels, if Minimum Bloom Size is set to .2, we will begin sampling from blur level 2 (the Pre-process image scaled to one quarter.) (The actual number of blur levels in the image is automatically determined by the image size.)\n\n\n\n  maxbloomradius - Determines the maximum blur level we sample from. It is 0 to 1, so if the image has 10 blur levels and a Maximum Bloom Size is set to .8, we will sample mipmap levels up to level 8. If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.\n\n\n\n  bloomthreshold - After the blur levels have been mixed, this cuts away the darkest part of the image, or, when < 0, it adds more of the full-image average.\n\n\n\n  bloomscurve - Reshapes the bloom rolloff so that it is tighter/steeper to the hot spots.\n\n\n\n  bloomfill - Makes the bloom wider.\n\n\n\n  bloomintensity - Final multiplier of accumulated bloom value.\n\n\n\n  output - Permits the user to select the image that is output; useful for previewing the outputs of each stage of the bloom pipeline. If set to \"Input\", the original image is output; if set to \"Preprocess\", the preprocessed image is output; \"Bloom\" outputs only the bloom value with alpha = 1; \"Bloom with Alpha\" outputs only bloom value with its computed alpha (max of R G and B); and \"Input + Bloom\" (the default) outputs the combined source image and bloom image.\n\n\n\n  inputimage0 - Multiplier for the input image value that is added in to the final bloom value.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times.

      "description": "The Bloom  creates a glow effect around bright parts of the input image that simulates light bouncing around a lens assembly of a camera. Parameters control how much of the bright spots of your input image get bloomed, how wide the bloom gets spread, and how it rolls off into the un-bloomed areas.\nThe bloom starts with a preprocessing stage (Pre-Black Level, Pre-Gamma, and Pre-Brightness), (similar to the Black Level, Brightness, and Gamma parameters of a Level TOP) which help to isolate the hot spots of the image that the bloom originates from (the Black Level), and boost the hot spots (Gamma and Brightness).  (Switch the Output menu for a moment to Pre-Process to make sure you have a good signal to bloom with.)\nThe second stage is a combination of scaled-down (blurred) levels of the pre-processed image: The first level is the original pre-processed image, the second level is scaled down to half size (essentially 4 pixels averaged into one pixel), the third is the second level scaled down to half, and so on until the \"top\" level is 1x1 pixel (the average of the whole image.) For example, a 1024 x 1024 input images gives 10 levels. (These are called mipmaps.)\nThe second stage blends a range of scaled-down blur levels using the Min Bloom Radius and Max Bloom Radius parameters, where 0 refers to the first scaled-down level and 1 refers to the top scaled-down level. The Min and Max determine how dispersed or smeared the blooming is. Note: If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.\nIn the third stage, the resulting bloom level is increased, reduced and shaped using Bloom Threshold, Bloom S-Curve, Bloom Fill and Bloom Intensity. Typically the Fill and Intensity parameters should be adjusted first, and then some adjustment with Threshold, Min and Max, and with more finesse, the S-Curve if necessary.\nTip: If you want to bloom something and composite it over something else or a variant of the original, set the Output parameter to Bloom with Alpha and add it (Add TOP) to something else.\nbloomTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  preblacklevel - Similar to the Black Level parameter of a Luma Level . Pixels with a luminosity less than this value are pushed to black.\n\n\n\n  pregamma - Similar to the Gamma parameter of a Luma Level , applies a gamma adjustment to the pixel value after the Pre-Black Level stage, which makes all non-zero values closer to RGB = 1, 1, 1.\n\n\n\n  prebrightness - Similar to the Brightness parameter of a Luma Level , it is a multiplier for the pixel value after the Pre-Gamma stage.\n\n\n\n  minbloomradius - Determines the minimum blur level to start sampling from. It is 0 to 1, so given a 1024x1024 image has 10 blur levels, if Minimum Bloom Size is set to .2, we will begin sampling from blur level 2 (the Pre-process image scaled to one quarter.) (The actual number of blur levels in the image is automatically determined by the image size.)\n\n\n\n  maxbloomradius - Determines the maximum blur level we sample from. It is 0 to 1, so if the image has 10 blur levels and a Maximum Bloom Size is set to .8, we will sample mipmap levels up to level 8. If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.\n\n\n\n  bloomthreshold - After the blur levels have been mixed, this cuts away the darkest part of the image, or, when < 0, it adds more of the full-image average.\n\n\n\n  bloomscurve - Reshapes the bloom rolloff so that it is tighter/steeper to the hot spots.\n\n\n\n  bloomfill - Makes the bloom wider.\n\n\n\n  bloomintensity - Final multiplier of accumulated bloom value.\n\n\n\n  output - Permits the user to select the image that is output; useful for previewing the outputs of each stage of the bloom pipeline. If set to \"Input\", the original image is output; if set to \"Preprocess\", the preprocessed image is output; \"Bloom\" outputs only the bloom value with alpha = 1; \"Bloom with Alpha\" outputs only bloom value with its computed alpha (max of R G and B); and \"Input + Bloom\" (the default) outputs the combined source image and bloom image.\n\n\n\n  inputimage0 - Multiplier for the input image value that is added in to the final bloom value.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's pixel format. rgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel. srgba8fixed - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. rgba16float - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel. rgba32float - Uses 32-bits per color channel, 128-bits per pixels. rgb10a2fixed - Uses 10-bits per color channel and 2-bits for alpha, 32-bits total per pixel. rgba16fixed - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits total per pixel. rgba11float - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue , 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA).

This can be used to emulate a physical camera or to send data to another program/device that can process FreeD tracking data.

FreeD data can be received from other devices using the corresponding FreeD In CHOP.\nThe channels used by the FreeD Out  are:\n\ncamera_id - a number from 0 - 255 that can be used to store an id number for the camera\ntx, ty, tz - camera position, can be connected to the Camera COMP Translate parameters. Values can range from +/- 131.07m.\nrx, ry, rz - camera rotation, can be connected to the Camera COMP Rotate parameters. Values can range from +/- 256 degrees.\nfocus - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the focus ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.\nzoom - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the zoom ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.\nuser - a 16-bit positive integer (0 - 65k) that can be used by the camera system to send custom user-defined dataNote: The FreeD Out  sends the 'D1' camera position and orientation message that is part of the FreeD protocol.\nfreedoutCHOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  active - Turn this parameter off to stop sending out data packets.\n\n\n\n  protocol -  - Selects the network protocol to use.

      "description": "From Derivative\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tJump to navigation\n\t\tJump to search\n\t\t\nThe Handle  is a new IK tool designed for manipulating groups of bones. Whereas the previous IK tools only allowed for a single end-affector per bone chain, this new method allows for several end-affectors per bone. Furthermore, the bones need not be a chain. Any setup, including branches, are handled.\t\t\nOne typical example is the use of motion capture data. In higher-end systems, you could have a cloud of marker positions and a skeleton to be driven by it.\t\t\t\nThis Handle  works in tandem with the Handle CHOP. The following setup is commonly used: Given a hierarchy of bones, attach one or more Handle Components to specific locations on each Bone . Assign each handle a target in space to follow. Create a Handle  which collects this information and calculates the rotation channels for the bones.  these values back to the bones.\nhandleCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  target - Where the Handle will pull the bone towards (like an end-affector).\n\n\n\t\t\n  t -  - Displacement tx,ty,tz relative to the origin of the bone where the handle is anchored.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\t\t\n  weight - When multiple handles are attached to a bone, higher weighted handles draw closer to their target.\n\n\n\t\t\n  twistonly - When enabled the handle only contributes the the z rotation of the bone, when disabled it points the bone (rx, ry, and rz).\n\n\n\t\t\n  falloff - This value affects how much parent bones are affected when the child bone is reaching a target. It affects the flexibility of the chain.\n\n\n\t\t\n  dorxlimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lrx -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in X axis.\n\nlrxmin -lrxmax -\n\t\t\n  dorylimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lry -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in Y axis.\n\nlrymin -lrymax -\n\t\t\n  dorzlimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lrz -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in Z axis.\n\nlrzmin -lrzmax -\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Handle  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.\n\n\n\nThe 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the Geometry COMP.\n\n\n\nAny component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.\n\n\n\nThe sub-Family of Component types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nTouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a Component of your TouchDesigner project.\n\n\n\nTOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of parenting. The \"parent component\" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root / is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also 3D Parenting and panel Parenting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Handle_COMP&oldid=30691\"\n\t\tCategory: COMPs",

      "description": "The Handle  is a new IK tool designed for manipulating groups of bones. Whereas the previous IK tools only allowed for a single end-affector per bone chain, this new method allows for several end-affectors per bone. Furthermore, the bones need not be a chain. Any setup, including branches, are handled.\t\t\nOne typical example is the use of motion capture data. In higher-end systems, you could have a cloud of marker positions and a skeleton to be driven by it.\t\t\t\nThis Handle  works in tandem with the Handle CHOP. The following setup is commonly used: Given a hierarchy of bones, attach one or more Handle Components to specific locations on each Bone . Assign each handle a target in space to follow. Create a Handle  which collects this information and calculates the rotation channels for the bones.  these values back to the bones.\nhandleCOMP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  target - Where the Handle will pull the bone towards (like an end-affector).\n\n\n\t\t\n  t -  - Displacement tx,ty,tz relative to the origin of the bone where the handle is anchored.\n\n tx - ty - tz -\n\t\t\n  weight - When multiple handles are attached to a bone, higher weighted handles draw closer to their target.\n\n\n\t\t\n  twistonly - When enabled the handle only contributes the the z rotation of the bone, when disabled it points the bone (rx, ry, and rz).\n\n\n\t\t\n  falloff - This value affects how much parent bones are affected when the child bone is reaching a target. It affects the flexibility of the chain.\n\n\n\t\t\n  dorxlimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lrx -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in X axis.\n\nlrxmin -lrxmax -\n\t\t\n  dorylimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lry -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in Y axis.\n\nlrymin -lrymax -\n\t\t\n  dorzlimit - These affects how much the bone is allowed to rotate with respect to its parent.\n\n\n\t\t\n  lrz -  - Set the minimum and maximum rotation range in Z axis.\n\nlrzmin -lrzmax -\n\n\n\nThe Display parameter page controls the component's material and rendering settings.\n\n  material - Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.\n\n\n\n  render - Whether the 's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the 's Render Flag.\n\n\n\n  drawpriority - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent , or if the  is the top level one listed in the Render 's '' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.\n\n\n\n  pickpriority - When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.\n\n\n\n  wcolor -  - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the 's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.\n\n wcolorr - wcolorg - wcolorb -\n\n  lightmask - By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  parameter page sets the component's python extensions.  Please see extensions for more information.\n\n  ext - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component\n\n\n\n  ext0object - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.\n\n\n    \n  ext0name - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.\n\n\n\n  ext0promote - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member.  Example:  n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction\n\n\n\n\n  reinitextensions - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common parameter page sets the component's node viewer and clone relationships.\n\n  parentshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  opshortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.\n\n\n\n  iop - Sequence header for internal operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to \"Internal \" below. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n  iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.\n\n\n\n\n  nodeview -  - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the  type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)\n\n default - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a  Viewer for Panel COMPs. opviewer - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.\n\n  opviewer - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator .\n\n\n\n  enablecloning - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's ' Master'.\n\n\n\n  enablecloningpulse - Instantaneously clone the contents.\n\n\n\n  clone -  to a component used as the Master Clone.\n\n\n\n  loadondemand - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltox - When on (default), the external  file will be loaded when the  starts and the contents of the  will match that of the external . This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external  on startup if desired (the contents of the  are instead loaded from the  file). Useful if you wish to have a  reference an external  but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n\n\n\n  enableexternaltoxpulse - This button will re-load from the external  file (if present).\n\n\n\n  externaltox -  to a  file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a . This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the  file can not be found, whatever the  file was saved with will be loaded.\n\n\n\n  reloadcustom - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  reloadbuiltin - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.\n\n\n\n  savebackup - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External  parameter is saved in the  file.  This backup copy will be used if the External  can not be found. This may happen if the  was renamed, deleted, or the  file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n\n\n\n  subcompname - When loading from an External  file, this option allows you to reach into the  and pull out a  and make that the top-level , ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that ). For example if a  file named project1 contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub- to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current . If this parameter is blank, it just loads the  file normally using the top level  in the file.\n\n\n\n  relpath -  - Set whether the child file paths within this  are relative to the  itself or the , or inherit from parent.\n\n inherit - Inherit setting from parent. project - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. externaltox - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the  file. When no external  file is specified, or when Enable External  is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.\n\n\n\nExtra Information for the Handle  can be accessed via an Info CHOP.\n\n\n\n - Number of children in this component.\n - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started. - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline. - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked. - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked. - 1 if operator was cooked this frame. - Number of warnings in this operator if any. - Number of errors in this operator if any.\nTouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditor2021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070\nCOMPs\n• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • \n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nExporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the CHOP Viewer is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See Parameter.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network.

A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A Camera COMP and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, \"Objects\" also refers to Python objects.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nA name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.\n\n\n\nAny of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They \"cook\" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See Node.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the Node Viewer), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a Pane that graphically shows the results of an operator.\n\n\n\nA custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using Panel Components.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component.

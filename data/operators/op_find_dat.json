For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with “wave”, or all nodes with the  parameter set to “master1”, or all Geometry components with a tag called “emitter”.\t\t\nThe criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a  containing certain strings.\t\t\t\nYou can also cause the  to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.\t\t\t\nCriteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find .\t\t\t\nFurthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback .\t\t\t\nWith the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an \"or\" or \"and\" on the pattern matching criterea.  \t\t\t\nIt also takes an optional  containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find ) which can be used to chain filters.\t\t\t\n\n\nThere is a variety of columns that you can select from including name, id, paths, type and tags.  (id is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)\t\t\t\nYou can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback , and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback . For example, you can output a custom column which is the tx parameter value of the node.\t\t\t\nYou can control when the OP Find  cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active  menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely.  You can also click the  parameter on Active  in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.\t\t\t\nInstead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find  can take an input  containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input  should contain the node “id” as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find  with the Column called “ID” turned on.\t\t\t\nFor example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or  parameter. The first OP Find  pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.\t\t\t\nRefer to Help -> Operator Snippets.\t\t\t\nSee also: Script DAT\nopfindDAT_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  activecook -  - Determines when to cook the .\n\n off - This stops the operator from cooking altogether. auto - Only cook / update the contents when the results would change. always - Continually cook this operator repeatedly for update cases that might be missed. incremental - This will cook each frame, but only add one result per cook, until all results are added.

Multi-line text is often a python Script or GLSL Shader, but can be any multi-line text. Tables are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.\n\n\n\nCloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A Component whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.\n\n\n\nTo re-compute the output data of the Operators. An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its Parameters change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) Scripting commands are run on the node. When the operator is a Panel Component, it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the Dependencies - the necessary operators in all Networks, contributing to a frame's total \"cook time\".\n\n\n\nTo \"pulse\" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an exported CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the .pulse() function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThe connection of an output of one node to the input of another node in a network. In contrast, see Link.\n\n\n\nHierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner.  3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family that contains its own Network. There are sixteen 3D Object Component and ten 2D Panel Component types. See also Network Path.\n\n\n\nThe Container component type is a Panel Component that holds, lays out and displays any number of other Panel Components.\n\n\n\nAn Operator Family which operate on Channels (a sequence of numbers (Samples)) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.\n\n\n\nA Operator Family that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.\n\n\n\nMATs or Materials are an Operator Family that applies a Shader to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.\n\n\n\nA Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax parent.Name, for example parent.Effect.width to obtain panel width.\n\n\n\nOperator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include Parent Shortcuts for accessing a component from within that component, and Global OP Shortcuts that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.\n\n\n\nThe location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, /geo1/circle1, a node called circle1 in a component called geo1. The path / is called Root. This path is displayed at the top of every Pane, showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or http: address, see Folder.\n\n\n\nA text string that contains data (string, float, list, boolean, etc.) and operators (+ * < etc) that are evaluated by the node's language (python or Tscript) and returns a string, float list or boolean, etc. Expressions are used in parameters, DATs and in scripts.\n\n\n\nThe Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.\n\n\n\nThe generic thing that holds an Operator, and includes Flags (display, bypass, lock, render, immune) and its position/size in the network. Whether you \"lay down an Operator\" or \"lay down an Node\", you're doing the same thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OP_Find_DAT&oldid=27897\"\n\t\tCategory: DATs",

      "description": "The OP Find  traverses the component hierarchy starting at one component and looking at all nodes within that component, and outputs a table with one row per node that matches criteria the user chooses. For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with “wave”, or all nodes with the  parameter set to “master1”, or all Geometry components with a tag called “emitter”.\t\t\nThe criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a  containing certain strings.\t\t\t\nYou can also cause the  to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.\t\t\t\nCriteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find .\t\t\t\nFurthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback .\t\t\t\nWith the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an \"or\" or \"and\" on the pattern matching criterea.  \t\t\t\nIt also takes an optional  containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find ) which can be used to chain filters.\t\t\t\n\n\nThere is a variety of columns that you can select from including name, id, paths, type and tags.  (id is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)\t\t\t\nYou can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback , and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback . For example, you can output a custom column which is the tx parameter value of the node.\t\t\t\nYou can control when the OP Find  cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active  menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely.  You can also click the  parameter on Active  in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.\t\t\t\nInstead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find  can take an input  containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input  should contain the node “id” as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find  with the Column called “ID” turned on.\t\t\t\nFor example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or  parameter. The first OP Find  pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.\t\t\t\nRefer to Help -> Operator Snippets.\t\t\t\nSee also: Script DAT\nopfindDAT_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n  activecook -  - Determines when to cook the .\n\n off - This stops the operator from cooking altogether. auto - Only cook / update the contents when the results would change. always - Continually cook this operator repeatedly for update cases that might be missed. incremental - This will cook each frame, but only add one result per cook, until all results are added.

It can either fit all the TOPs into a specific resolution (determined by the Common page) by scaling the inputs, or it can scale its own resolution to be larger to accomodate the native resolution of the inputs.\nEach input image gets equal area of the output, and the Fit menu determines how each image fits into its designated area.\nMultiple inputs can be wired into the  , or the  parameter can contain paths to multiple TOPs. In the final layout, the TOPs specified in the  parameter will appear before the TOPs of the wired inputs if both are used.\nlayoutTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  top - Specify the path(s) to a  to include in the layout.\n\n\n\n  scaleres - When 'off', the resolution of the first wired input is used, or a custom resolution can be specified on the Common page. When 'on' and the output resolution is 'Use Input', the  's resolution is the first input's resolution scaled up by number of columns horiontally, and the number of rows vertically. For example, if there are 4 input textures and the first one is 1280x720 and Align Left to Right is selected, then the grid size is 4x1 and so the final resolution will be 5120x720 (ie. (1280*4)x(720*1)). However whether off or on, each texture gets an allotted space of the same size. How the texture fits into that space is determined using the Fit parameter.\n\n\n\n  align -  - The menu determines how the inputs are laid out, in row, column , or grid format.\n\n none - horizlr - horizrl - verttb - vertbt - gridrows - gridcols -\n\n  fit -  - Determines how the input images are fit to the space they are given.

This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels.

This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on.

It can either fit all the TOPs into a specific resolution (determined by the Common page) by scaling the inputs, or it can scale its own resolution to be larger to accomodate the native resolution of the inputs.\nEach input image gets equal area of the output, and the Fit menu determines how each image fits into its designated area.\nMultiple inputs can be wired into the  , or the  parameter can contain paths to multiple TOPs. In the final layout, the TOPs specified in the  parameter will appear before the TOPs of the wired inputs if both are used.\nlayoutTOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  top - Specify the path(s) to a  to include in the layout.\n\n\n\n  scaleres - When 'off', the resolution of the first wired input is used, or a custom resolution can be specified on the Common page. When 'on' and the output resolution is 'Use Input', the  's resolution is the first input's resolution scaled up by number of columns horiontally, and the number of rows vertically. For example, if there are 4 input textures and the first one is 1280x720 and Align Left to Right is selected, then the grid size is 4x1 and so the final resolution will be 5120x720 (ie. (1280*4)x(720*1)). However whether off or on, each texture gets an allotted space of the same size. How the texture fits into that space is determined using the Fit parameter.\n\n\n\n  align -  - The menu determines how the inputs are laid out, in row, column , or grid format.\n\n none - horizlr - horizrl - verttb - vertbt - gridrows - gridcols -\n\n  fit -  - Determines how the input images are fit to the space they are given. Depending on the setting, it will either fit the entire image inside the space given or crop some of the image off.\n\n fill - fithorz - fitvert - fitbest - fitoutside - nativeres -\n\n  maxrows - Maximum number of rows until a new column is started.\n\n\n\n  maxcols - Maximum number of columns until a new row is started.\n\n\n\n  bcolor -  - The color of the border around each input.\n\n bcolorr - bcolorg - bcolorb - bcolora -\n\n  borders -  - The border width for each input. The borders will scale down the input.\n\n bordersl - bordersr - bordersb - borderst -\n\n  bgcolor -  - Color and alpha for the space not covered by the input images.\n\n bgcolorr - bgcolorg - bgcolorb - bgcolora -\n\n  premultrgbbyalpha - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.\n\n\n\n  compover - Fill any area with the background color if it has alpha less than 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n  xord -  - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your inputs will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.\n\n srt - str - rst - rts - tsr - trs -\n\n  t -  - The two fields for Translate allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes for each input image.\n\n tx - ty -\n\t\t\n  tunit - \n\n\n\t\t\n  rotate - The field for rotation allows you to specify the amount of rotation for each input image.\n\n\n\t\t\n  s -  - The two fields for Scale allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes for each input image.\n\n sx - sy -\n\n  legacyxform - When enabled, will use the legacy method of building the transform matrix, which has inverted rotation and transform order.\n\n\n\n\n\n  outputresolution -  - quickly change the resolution of the 's data.\n\n useinput - Uses the input's resolution. eighth - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. quarter - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. half - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 2x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 4x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. 8x - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount. fit - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio. limit - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio. custom - Enables the  parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.\n\n  resolution -  - Enabled only when the  parameter is set to Custom . Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.\n\n resolutionw - resolutionh -\n\n  resmenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.\n\n\n\n  resmult - Uses the Global  Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global  Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this  is affected by the global multiplier.\n\n\n\n  outputaspect -  - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)\n\n useinput - Uses the input's aspect ratio. resolution - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square. custom - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.\n\n  aspect -  - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.\n\n aspect1 - aspect2 -\n\n  armenu - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.\n\n\n\n  inputfiltertype -  - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the .\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  fillmode -  - Determine how the  image is displayed in the viewer.\nNOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native  as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.\n\n\n useinput - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input. fill - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer. width - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally. height - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically. best - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped. outside - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer. nativeres - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.\n\n  filtertype -  - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.\n\n nearest - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native . linear - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get  images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native . mipmap - Uses  mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.\n\n  npasses - Duplicates the operation of the  the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.\n\n\n\n  chanmask - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the  will operate on. All channels are selected by default.\n\n\n\n  format -  - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A).

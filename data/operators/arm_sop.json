      "description": "The Arm  creates all the necessary geometry for an arm, and provides a smooth, untwisted skin that connects the arm to the body. It is controlled through inverse kinematics linked to a handprint.\narmSOP_Class\n\nContents\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  capttype -  - You can use either Ellipses or Capture Regions as deformation geometry. Ellipses are for use with the Skeleton . Capture Regions are for use with the Capture .\n\n ellipses - cregions -\n\t\t\n  axis -  - Position the model along the +X or -X axis.\n\n posx - negx -\n\t\t\n  bonerad - Controls the scale of the circle radii.\n\n\n\t\t\n  rotatehand - This parameter rotates the hand and the wrist joint to match the orientation of the hand-print object. In order to operate correctly, the end-affector (hand print) scale transformations must remain at 1.\t\nNote: If the channel is set to 0, then the hand rotations are relative to the forearm. If the channel is set to 1, the hand rotations are the same orientation as the end affector.\n\n\n\t\t\n  autoelbow - This parameter affects the default twist of the elbow joint to a more natural position.\n\n\n\t\t\n  elbowtwist - Specifies the rotation angle of the elbow joint.\n\n\n\t\t\n  flipelbow - This toggle positions the arm using an alternative elbow position solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  clavlength - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  humlength - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  ulnalength - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  handlength - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  shoulder - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  elbow - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\t\t\n  wrist - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the arm is positioned to reach the end affector (hand print), the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints may produce unnatural looking bends. The transform fields allow manual adjustment of each controlling circle of each joint to fix this.\t\t\nEach joint circle (e.g. Shoulder 1) is given three transform fields (two translates and one scale). These values are scaled by the amount of bend applied to the particular joint. In other words, when the arm is fully extended, the transforms have no effect. When the arm joint angles are at 90, they have maximum effect. Thus, set the joints to 90 before adjusting these values.\n\n  shoulder1t -  - The X, Z position of the first shoulder circle, as well as its overall scale.\n\n shoulder1tx - The X position of the first shoulder circle. shoulder1ty - The Z position of the first shoulder circle.

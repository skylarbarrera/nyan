NYAN - IMPROVEMENT IDEAS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
===============================================

This file contains potential improvements beyond the basic Claude tooling setup.

## MCP Server Enhancements

### Live State Sync
- WebSocket bridge for real-time TD state → Claude awareness
- Automatic node graph diffing to track changes
- Parameter change notifications for reactive workflows

### Template Library MCP
- Custom MCP server exposing reusable .tox components
- Parameterized templates: "create audio-reactive system with 4 bands"
- Version-controlled component library

## Claude Skills (If Implemented)

### /td-node
Create TouchDesigner nodes via natural language:
  "/td-node noise feeding into a feedback loop with blur"

### /td-analyze
Analyze current TD network structure:
  "/td-analyze" → returns network topology, bottlenecks, optimization suggestions

### /td-export
Export Python scripts from TD back to src/:
  "/td-export script1" → extracts and formats for version control

## Python Tooling Extensions

### TD Type Stubs
- Generate .pyi stubs from TouchDesigner's internal Python API
- Enable pyright/mypy checking for TD scripts
- Auto-complete in VS Code for op(), par., etc.

### Hot Reload Bridge
- File watcher that pushes src/ changes into TD DATs
- No manual "reload" needed during development
- Works via TD's built-in HTTP server or MCP

### Test Framework
- pytest fixtures that mock TD's op() and par objects
- Unit test Python logic outside of TouchDesigner
- CI/CD pipeline for script validation

## Network Patterns Library

### Common Systems (as documented patterns)
- Audio-reactive: FFT → CHOP math → instancing
- Video feedback: TOP chain with delay/composite
- Data visualization: Table DAT → instanced geometry
- OSC/MIDI input: CHOP routing → parameter mapping

### Architecture Templates
- Main timeline with cue system
- Multi-output projection mapping base
- Interactive installation with sensor input
- Live performance rig with MIDI control

## Windows-Specific

### PowerShell Scripts
- `scripts/start-td.ps1` - Launch TD with project loaded
- `scripts/sync-scripts.ps1` - Push src/ to TD project

### Path Handling
- .env file for TD installation path
- Cross-platform path resolution in Python utils

## Integration Ideas

### Git Hooks
- Pre-commit: Lint Python, validate JSON configs
- Post-checkout: Notify if .toe file changed (manual reload needed)

### Asset Pipeline
- Watch folder for new media → auto-import to TD
- Texture optimization (resize, format conversion)
- Media manifest for project dependencies

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- Frame time logging from TD
- GPU/CPU usage correlation with node complexity
- Automated bottleneck detection

### Profiling Integration
- Export TD's cook times to analyzable format
- Compare before/after optimization attempts

===============================================
Priority: Start with TD Type Stubs and Hot Reload Bridge
These provide the most immediate development quality-of-life improvements.
